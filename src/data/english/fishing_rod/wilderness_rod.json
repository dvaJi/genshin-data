  "description": "A rather pedestrian-looking wooden fishing rod. Apart from being quite sturdy, even to point where you could use it for self-defense, it lacks any sort of special features. But the old adage holds true — \"the novice's rod shall be the tent-pole of their veterancy.\" Even the greatest of anglers must surely have started with this simple implement.",
