  "description": "A fruit that grows in the warmer parts of Nod-Krai. It is beloved by animals emerging from winter and hungry children alike.<br/>In the legacy of the Frostmoon Scions, Midsommar Berries are regarded as a symbol of life and abundance, for they only flourish during the warmth of spring and summer.<br/>There is a tale that tells of the endless struggle between the King of Winter Holly and the King of Summer Oak — twin monarchs that slay each other as the seasons change, returning from the underworld to rule in turn until the end of time. Most Snezhnayan scholars dismiss this as a primitive religious metaphor for the alternating seasons — or at least that's what they tell themselves.",
