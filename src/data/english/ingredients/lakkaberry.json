  "description": "A fruit as white as pearl that tastes refreshingly sweet.<br/>In the legends of the Frostmoon Scions, these fruits, like kuuhenki, are a gift from the Moon Maiden, a sacred symbol blessed by the new moon. Therefore, sharing and eating delicious Lakkaberries is also a form of worshipping Kuutar.<br/>Even when not associated with the divine, their plumpness and sweetness alone are enough to awaken one's appetite.",
