  "description": "The already-cooled blood and fire still maintain the shape of a feather, that is framed with solidified sleek black threads.<br/>Before their thoughts have matured, young children are reliant on the meticulous care of their parents, just as fledglings need the aegis of an adult wing.<br/>It is to fulfill such wishes that \"Father\" wove dangerous spider-silk into a facsimile of feathers, that she might grant her family some warmth.",
