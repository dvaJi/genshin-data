  "description": "Conflict is considered reason in the Nation of Pyro.<br/>Conflicts can always be resolved by greater powers. This fact means that they can always be managed, as opposed to developing into something uncontrollable. Conflict is also a kind of limitation, preventing people from endless shirking of responsibilities without weighing the costs. It demands that participants settle their scores decisively and efficiently.",
