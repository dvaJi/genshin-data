  "description": "Offering up kindling is the established rule of the Nation of Pyro.<br/>What is meant by offering kindling is to offer up a sacrifice before one obtains something, though it does not always guarantee a response or return. Its true meaning lies in paying a price without expecting a reward â€” for in the end, the day when the fruits will be reaped is sure to come.",
