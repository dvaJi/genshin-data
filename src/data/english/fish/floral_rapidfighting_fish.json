  "name": "Floral Rapidfighting Fish",
  "description": "Despite the name it has been given, this creature is not actually a fish, but a medium-sized amphibian. It has a rather unique appearance with a distinctive flat head that bears a striking resemblance to a fist blade, giving it the look of being constantly ready for fierce battles with its natural enemies. In fact, they are gentle in nature and not aggressive in the slightest. The real purpose of their formidable-looking \"blades\" is to reduce water resistance when swimming through rivers. Thanks to their special head structure, they can navigate swiftly against the flow of turbulent currents, earning them the name \"Rapidfighting Fish.\"<br/>Owing to their vivid pink hue, these Rapidfighting Fish have been given the prefix \"Floral,\" which has caused some tourists to mistakenly associate them with the Flower-Feather Clan or Qucusaurs. It is said that this color provides particularly effective camouflage against their natural adversaries, especially when in shallow waters against a backdrop of reddish-brown rocks.",
