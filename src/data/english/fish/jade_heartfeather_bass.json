  "description": "Peculiar fish that look like a heart from the side, which are said to be related to bass. Their dorsal and ventral fins are comprised of flexible bones that are as slender as feathers, hence the proposed name \"Heartfeather Bass.\"<br/>Jade Heartfeather Bass are named for the jade-like coloration they take on in the water. Despite their gentle appearances, they possess remarkable resilience and can adapt to diverse aquatic environments. The clear water in Chenyu Vale is especially suitable for them, where they thrive and live a carefree, comfortable life.",
