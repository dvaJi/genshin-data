  "description": "A crab that makes its home in borrowed shells.\\nArmored Crabs are constantly searching for shells that fit their bodies as they grow. A storybook that told the tale of the trials of an Armored Crab searching for a suitable shell was extremely popular in Fontaine for a time. Though the story is filled with childlike wonder, the reaction after proved that, like many fairytales, it touched adults even more deeply.",
