  "description": "An elegant elemental life form that possesses immense elemental affinity. The long years have exposed it to high concentrations of Hydro, resulting in its present form.\\nIts clear, glass-like body is composed almost entirely of the purest water droplets. Though gentler than most of its kin, once provoked it can instantly shape the surrounding water into razor-sharp blades capable of piercing any unwary intruder's defenses.\\nIn still-extant prayers of the far north, it was born from the Frost Moon's blessings, symbolizing the pure source and the first radiance. Perhaps this is why it finds the tainting of its pale purity with the seven colors of heavenly light unbearable, thus rejecting all life that draws too close.",
