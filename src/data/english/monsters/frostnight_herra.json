  "description": "Proud beings that roam in the waning glow of the moon, wielding ancient powers long since tamed by the Lord of the Sky.\\nLegends say these graceful, mystical beasts were born in the age when the Frost Moon still turned, and, favored by the divine emissary, they would not be tainted by the light of day. Even now, among the followers of the Frost Moon, they are regarded as sacred beasts lost to this world, retreating along secret lunar paths beyond the reach of mortal eyes. Yet, as they have for countless centuries past, they still wander in the shadows of the moon, treading the boundary between two worlds, guarding the lands coveted by calamity, and watching over those who dwell within them — for this is the very oath they first swore to the apostle of the golden city.",
