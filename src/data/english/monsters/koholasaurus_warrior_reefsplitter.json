  "description": "A powerful warrior from the source of the springs, whose bravery has been acknowledged and for which they may wear the Saurian Crown.\\nA warrior who can temporarily harness the power of the waves to shuttle back and forth. It is said that one must undergo three states of training to master this skill: First, to adapt. Second, to submit. Finally, to drive. Mastering this method of movement is merely the entry-level requirement to become a Saurian-Crowned Warrior of the People of the Springs, and the greatest among these Warriors can even use this skill to sail on land.",
