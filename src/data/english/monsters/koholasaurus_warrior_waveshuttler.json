  "description": "A powerful warrior from the source of the springs, whose bravery has been acknowledged and for which they may wear the Saurian Crown.\\nA warrior who can temporarily harness the power of the waves to shuttle back and forth. According to legend, the tribe's heroes can take advantage of exceptional speed to move across the waves with no need of any tool. Today, the tribe believes this to be a sophisticated, complex art used to drive the waves, with the way one moves being at its heart.",
