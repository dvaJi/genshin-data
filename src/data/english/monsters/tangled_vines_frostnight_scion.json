  "description": "An elegant elemental life form that possesses immense elemental affinity. The long years have exposed it to high concentrations of Dendro, resulting in its present form.\\nThis entity has a marvelous resonance with the plant life of the groves. Some say that one of the Moonchanters once made a contract with the wooded lands with their help, thus becoming a friend and companion to all life on this land.\\nIn still-extant prayers of the far north, it was born from the Frost Moon's blessings, symbolizing the pure source and the first radiance. Perhaps this is why it finds the tainting of its pale purity with the seven colors of heavenly light unbearable, thus rejecting all life that draws too close.",
