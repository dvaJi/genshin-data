  "description": "Various bizarrely-shaped machines that have taken different forms and functions to adapt to different goals.\\nLegend has it that they are war machines left behind by a nation that has already been destroyed. Compared to the more common Ruin Guards, their design has greater value in the study of biomimesis. The insect-like limbs are more agile than those of humanoid machines. The shield formed by its various components can resist any frontal attack.",
