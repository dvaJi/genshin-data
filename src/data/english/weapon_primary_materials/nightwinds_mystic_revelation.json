  "description": "Regardless of how they are polished, representations of worldly matter cannot be made to transcend their physical nature â€” they will always remain material in essence. Similarly, pure human spirit can neither be expressed solely through the \"tree\" of intention, nor embodied through obsidian mirrors that need constant polishing. As the power of the Night Kingdom and the Nightsouls grew, so too did the types of objects that could be used for spiritual fusion. Eventually, the Wayob came to be capable of conveying revelations of the Night Kingdom through various thoughts alone, dispensing of the need for devotees to perform the ritual of polishing stones into mirrors. Thus were such ritual tools rendered obsolete.",
