  "description": "In the long years when the night grasped the land, the first Torchforger lit the flames that dispelled the darkness and swore vigilance against the black tide, so earning the royal edict that established the Lightkeepers.<br/>Unlike the Marechaussee Hunters of the high seas, the Lightkeepers who patrolled the night did not possess any ancient techniques from a lost empire, or prestigious titles and ranks. All they could rely on was weak flesh clad in silver armor, the swords and lamps in their hands, and an ancient oath passed down through generations.<br/>No matter how many souls perish beneath the dim light, the dark disaster cannot overturn mortal resolve — for the long night can only steal life, and not the dawn that will eventually rise.",
