  "description": "The Lord of Flowers was in an amicable relationship with the Jinn.<br/>The Mistress of Flowers and Oases joined hands with the Lord of Deserts and built Ay-Khanoum, the \"City of Amphitheaters,\" which carried the meaning of \"City of the Moon Maiden\" in the ancient language of the Jinn.<br/>Later, however, it was said that the Lord of Flowers died due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand, after which the blossoms of purple Padisarahs were never seen again in the oases.<br/>After the departure of the Lord of Flowers, the sandstorms keened, the Jinn sobbed, and the moonlight-silver gem disc lost its original, glad purpose, giving off a mournful glimmer.",
