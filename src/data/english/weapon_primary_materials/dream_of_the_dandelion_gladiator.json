  "description": "Vennessa may have been freed from slavery, but she then found herself subject to many other, even greater forms of bondage. What began as a duty to her tribespeople extended to all of Mondstadt, then to the concept of freedom itself, and beyond a point even to the whole world.<br/>What she really hoped for, in truth, was that the world might grow stronger.",
