  "description": "It is told that in the years before the country of gold and white stone sank, the moon-worshipping ancestors were guided by the star of dawn to build a tower reaching to the heavens.<br/>Later on, the most transgressive of wild fantasies, one to unify life and the world into one, one that even the monarch who ruled all nations on earth failed to achieve, was toppled along with the city in the wrath of the high heavens.<br/>The homeless survivors fled to the south by the waning light of the Frostmoon, chanting in tears of a glory that belonged to them millennia ago.",
