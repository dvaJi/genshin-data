  "description": "It was in that era that the first human to ascend arose from the throne to enter the Sacred Flame, while the mortal world awaited the arrival of their successor.<br/>It was also the era that the mastermind took up the reins of all authority in their stead.<br/>Unfortunately, this self-proclaimed Sacred Lord, this usurper who believed that the god he had loved and shed golden tears for should forever remain the one and only â€” overstepped his authority. Placing selfish desire above the commandments left by that revered god, he established a city in which the heavens and the earth were separated from one another.",
