  "description": "\"If you wish to possess all that the world has to offer, you must first offer all you have to the world.\"<br/>After the Sacred Lord of the ineffable city forbade the people from praying to the Night Kingdom, the spiritual bonds that had once been established fell into ruin.<br/>The scarlet-eyed youth, guided through numerous trials, now faced his final test: to emulate the first human to ascend and confront his own demise by offering up his heart with a golden dagger.<br/>Self-sacrifice was seen as an honor reserved for the victor â€” and thus, without even a moment's hesitation, he sliced open his chest with the gleaming blade.<br/>In the end, his sacrifice received the response it deserved, and he was able to return from the kingdom where water flows as rays of light to set out upon a grand new endeavor.",
