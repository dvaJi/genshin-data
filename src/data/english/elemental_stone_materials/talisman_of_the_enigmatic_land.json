  "name": "Talisman of the Enigmatic Land",
  "description": "In some records kept by the Masters of the Night-Wind, priests masterful in Spiritspeaking can use meditation to pass their consciousness through the light and shadow that reflects off obsidian, thus reaching the enigmatic underground realm that only the dead may enter. This deed is, however, perilous, and priests who perform it must often wear such talismans to guard their souls from being lost in that mysterious land. However, this talisman's symbolic value far outstrips its real effects. Perhaps the hermit-priest who grants this to a warrior who passes the test only does so as a simple blessing.",
