  "description": "Some say that the cores that power all the Secret Source Automatons are actually the same kind of device, and that they simply carry different information, as attested to by the fact that the golden patterns on them are different. At first, the many commands were only added to the circuits to aid in its smooth running, but it seems that all the superimposition and layering of orders onto one another has wound up creating a rudimentary artificial intelligence.",
