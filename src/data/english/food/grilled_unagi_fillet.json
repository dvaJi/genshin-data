      "description": "A grilled dish. The fat oils sizzle all across the meat's surface like a flowery prelude. The baptism of charcoal fire and moistening sauce has imparted a delicate softness to the unagi's mouthfeel. If you paired this was rice, you'd be liable to leave not even a single drop of sauce behind.",
