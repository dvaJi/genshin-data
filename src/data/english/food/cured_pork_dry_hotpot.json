  "description": "A dish fried over a great flame. Matsutake and Ham have been sliced up, stir-fried, and garnished with some spicy condiments. The flavor of the Ham is a match for the Matsutake's crispness, and the combination grows ever lovelier and more addictive as you chew. The heat-conducting wok also serves to keep it piping hot for long periods.",
