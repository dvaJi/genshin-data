  "description": "A hard-to-prepare fish dish. The fish is first completely deboned before crisscross cuts are made on the skin. The fish is then coated in flour and deep-fried to a golden-brown color, then served with ketchup drizzled on top. It is tender and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The dish resembles a squirrel's tail to a certain degree, hence the name.",
