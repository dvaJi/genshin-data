  "description": "This street lamp has a small ceiling, and while its workmanship can seem quite rough, it provides excellent and continuous lighting through the wind and rain. Its structure is more practical than pretty, and when its tenon pin is removed, its top half can be rotated longitudinally, allowing artisans to replace the mounted lantern without using a ladder or some kind of stepping stone.",
