  "description": "A delightfully chaotic obstacle roller crowned with a prominent Asha emblem, from afar it resembles a miniature Asha dashing at full tilt. Originally designed as a mobile cleaning apparatus for the resort, it proved wholly unsuited for that purpose. Its wild, gyroscopic movements not only failed to tidy anything but instead sent all in its path flying. Fortunately, it has since found a more fitting role as a formidable challenge in the obstacle course.",
