  "description": "A suspended chair supported by gracefully-curved trees, the seat held by vibrant vines twisted into ropes, while the trunks and beams are dotted with clusters of blue and white flowers that exude a pervasive fragrance capable of carrying people off to a floral sea in the clouds. This chair once served as a swing, but due to the dream-like aura it has, people who play on it run the risk of swinging ever higher, which can result in various accidents. Thus, the craftspeople chose to fix the seat in place, rendering it a facility intended purely for rest.",
