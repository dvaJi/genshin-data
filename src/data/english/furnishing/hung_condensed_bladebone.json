  "description": "A tree commonly found in Chenyu Vale with sharp, slender leaves that remain evergreen. This straight-trunked tree is often called a \"Bladebone\" in Liyue. Legend has it that such trees were shaped over long years by the mountain winds blowing from Mt. Xuanlian, hardening them and giving them a solid and dense wood that is favored by carpenters and other artisans.",
