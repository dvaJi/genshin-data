  "description": "A rack made of light but sturdy Adhigama Wood that has different fish hanging off it. Anglers often use this tool to dry small fish for their own consumption. Most places in Sumeru feature stable ecosystems. Fish caught from nutrient-rich water bodies taste fresh and juicy, and freshwater fish are often used to make Tahchin, a delicious and filling dish served in large quantities.",
