  "description": "A gorgeous and elaborate \"Good Shelf,\" this origami decoration features sturdy and reliable trays and clockwork-shaped toy displays ideal for showing off figurines related to the fairytale Constellation Metropole.\\nAs it turns out, an extravagant-looking Frame that happens to be completely empty is not worthy of being called a \"Good Shelf.\" What really makes a Good Shelf is the carefully selected combination of fairytale figurines displayed on it.",
