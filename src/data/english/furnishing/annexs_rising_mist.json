  "description": "The standard staircase of the Illusory Annex has been designed with precise consideration for the overall angle and the height of each step, allowing people to easily ascend and descend regardless of age. Additionally, the use of stone in the staircase, treated with unique thermal processing, maintains a cool temperature over extended periods. Combined with the distinctive interior design, this helps regulate the indoor temperature to a certain extent, contributing to the creation of a visually pleasing and comfortable indoor environment.",
