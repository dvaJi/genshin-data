  "name": "Redbill Pelican",
  "description": "A type of waterfowl that dwells in open water bodies such as lakes and rivers. A pointed crimson-hued beak and magnificently colored plumage are its distinguishing characteristics.\\nRedbill Pelicans are born to fish, and their innate talent for doing so remains unchanged even when they are in a place like The Realm Within with its abundant supply of food. Their greatest joy is to silently observe the movements of fish within the Pool of Sapphire Grace. But fret notâ€” these avians with keen eyesight will never even entertain the notion of attacking unless Tubby allows it.",
