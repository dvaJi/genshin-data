  "description": "A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.\\nThese lizards have pretty red scales and will detach their tails to escape when caught.\\nLizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.\\nOnce they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up. They will, for reasons unknown, also turn bright green. \\nThe worldly Chubby surmises that, on rare occasions, Sub-Space Creation might allow the lizards' severed tails to regenerate into a full-grown, independent lizard. However, this theory has not been tested on account of rules against animal cruelty in the Realm Within.",
