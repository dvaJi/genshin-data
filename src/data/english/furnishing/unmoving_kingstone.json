  "description": "A lofty stone with a consistent grain. A highly skilled craftsperson can sculpt stones like this into ornamental rock features that imitate rugged mountains. Giant rocks like this one are used at the foundations of Yujing Terrace.\\nAn urban legend holds that the lightning-fast blade-work of the Yuheng took 10 years of intense training to master and that one stage of this training involved hacking away at an Unmoving Kingstone until its surface was smooth and shiny like a mirror.",
