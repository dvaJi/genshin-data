  "description": "A very sturdy crate built from Adhigama Wood that is coated with fire-resistant materials. A great number of military supplies are stored within it. The crate is resilient to regular fire and brute force.\\nIt is said that the Akademiya sent a temporary liaison to coordinate its cooperation with the Corps of Thirty, but that this person was so single-mindedly focused on the accuracy of language. As a result, they wound up producing a beautifully written (but confusingly structured) list that is filled with jargon such as \"elastic supplies\" and \"emergency provisions.\" It proved a massive headache for the under-educated sellswords.\\nTheir confusion ended during a meal when a certain mercenary with long, black-and-golden hair came to visit her friends at the Corps of Thirty. She explained the liaison's professional vocabulary in simple language, and divided them into several categories â€” \"the essentials of combat,\" \"the preferred,\" and \"the meaningless,\" thus putting an end to the confusion. Since then, \"The Essentials\" have become the common name for various military supplies amongst different mercenary groups.",
