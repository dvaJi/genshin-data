  "description": "A two-legged Saurian doll made from Peach Palm Wood, decorated with blue and red graffiti. They can often be found accompanying Saurian whelps or young children all over Natlan. The creator intentionally designed these puppets to wobble, resembling young Saurians still learning to walk. It is said that this design aims to give less agile Saurian whelps or children more confidence, encouraging them to bravely continue their unsteady travail toward mastery over walking.",
