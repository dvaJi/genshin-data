  "description": "A four-legged Peach Palm Wood-carved Alpaca doll that is adorned with blue and red graffiti. They can often be found accompanying Saurian whelps or young children all over Natlan. This one is very steady indeed, matching the character of the Alpaca. Countless children and Saurian whelps have grown up with its companionship and protection, thus becoming as reliable as it is.",
