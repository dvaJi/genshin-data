  "description": "A fixed torch made with a stand of \"Ashen Aratiku Wood\" and a metal fire basin, seen in various locations within the Flower-Feather Clan.\\nUnlike other tribes, the Flower-Feather Clan seems to favor open flames over phlogiston as their primary outdoor light source. Some speculate that the roaring flames symbolize the tribe's burning desire for victory. Others believe it's simply because phlogiston offers better visibility, making it more suitable for guiding flight.",
