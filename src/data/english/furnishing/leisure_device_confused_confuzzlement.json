  "description": "A furnishing combination made with great care by Tubby, this set comprises a Seeker's Board and many Confuzzled Tubbers. After interacting with the Seeker's Board, you can begin a treasure hunt or view hunt records. The Confuzzled Tubbers can be freely placed within a set space, where they will continuously remain. You can combine these placements with pre-existing furnishings within the Serenitea Pot to hide the Tubbers, after which you will have to search for these Tubbers within a time limit.\\nAfter hearing about Mondstadt's traditional game, Windtrace, from the Traveler, Tubby also resolved to create a game based around hide-and-seek, thus creating this particular furnishing combination. However, such a game that only involved Tubby, the Traveler, and Paimon would have too few people and thus lack a certain fun factor. As such, Tubby created many \"Confuzzled Tubber\" toys to play the role of other participants. Tubby even suggested that the Traveler could use adeptal energies to create playing fields and invite friends to come and experience the fun together.\\nIt seems that Tubby shares senses with the Confuzzled Tubbers, which can allow her to drink tea in peace within her teacup while enjoying the games.\\nNot that this has anything to do with Tubby growing both tubbier and lazier lately, of course.",
