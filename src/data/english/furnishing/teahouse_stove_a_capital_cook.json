  "name": "Teahouse Stove: A Capital Cook",
  "description": "A frying device made from durable stone and Sandbearer Wood that comes with a stove with great firepower that retains precise adjustability. The wok itself has an ingenious curvature that can improve the tea-frying efficiency.\\nJust like in cooking, the higher the flame, the sterner the test of the teamaker's skills, because one must control the wok temperature very carefully when frying tea. Those who are qualified to control the stove in a teahouse are often artisans who can more than hold their own.",
