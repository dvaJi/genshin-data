  "description": "A roof that has \"Valberry Red\" as its main color theme. It seems able to improve the flavor of desserts sold at the shop, albeit only psychologically. As one gazes at this roof from afar, it is almost as if some delicious taste is already developing at the tip of one's tongue. It can also exert an appetizing effect in advance when it comes to snacks — an example of using visuals to one's advantage.\\nThe only issue is that some birds that love to pick Valberries might come along and peck small holes in the roof. \"Whenever Paimon gets up there to chase those birds off, she ends up getting taken for a ride by them and not catching a single one — something that makes her mad enough to stomp about for quite a while.\"\\n\"But every time I suggest that I could just throw Paimon up there, which should give her the initial speed she needs to catch those rascals, she refuses.\"",
