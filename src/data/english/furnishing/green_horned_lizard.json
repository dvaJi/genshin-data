  "description": "A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.\\nThese lizards have lovely green scales and will discard their tails to escape when caught.\\nLizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.\\nOnce they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up. \\nOut in the wild, some large birds prey upon the lizards, so they naturally live in fear of the two teapot spirits in the Realm Within.",
