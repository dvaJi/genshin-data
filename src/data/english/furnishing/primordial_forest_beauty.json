  "description": "A gate in the fencing around the Calligraphy Tavern in the Simulanka. The frame is of peculiar design, like the limb of a tree, while a sign depicting flowers is hung from the apex. A guest who sometimes travels here from Constellation Metropole offered this review: \"It's altogether natural for a tavern in the forest to have a gate made from tree branches. Nothing else would fit the primordial ecosystem aesthetic.\" This point of view is quite popular among certain circles in Constellation Metropole. However, from the perspective of the residents of the Forest of Blessings, they had originally wanted a nice rectangular door frame, but for them, the process of processing the wood was just too complicated. So, in the end, they went with the \"native ecosystem\" feel.",
