  "description": "A beautifully crafted and expensive sealed jar, adorned with special graffiti designs commonly found in the realms of the Masters of the Night-Wind. These graffiti patterns are said to be a form of Phlogiston Engraving inscription, believed to have the power to extend the freshness of the jar's contents. As a result, such jars are often used to store precious medicines and pigments.",
