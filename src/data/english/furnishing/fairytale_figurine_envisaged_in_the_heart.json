  "description": "A flying squirrel wearing both a crown and a noble, resolute appearance. Can be placed on a \"Good Shelf\" for display.\\nThis model is based on a certain Princess from the Kingdom of Breezes and Bells. Interestingly, when this princess was posing for the model, she chose an identical pose to that of Clanche â€” arms folded in, ready to vault into the skies. Perhaps the scene of themselves \"seizing the skies\" is something that all flying squirrels envisage in their hearts.",
