  "description": "A wooden flower bed commonly found in Inazuma City. \\Although the art of ikebana is not as famous as that of the tea ceremony, it is one of the most important arts in Inazuma. However, in recent times, the people do not have much spare Mora in their hands. Thus, it is difficult for craftsmen skilled in ikebana to make ends meet. Therefore, the Yashiro Commission has applied for funds for the maintenance of public greenery and installed numerous flower beds in the city to create orders and income for the florists, thus preserving this traditional art in a legal and reasonable way.",
