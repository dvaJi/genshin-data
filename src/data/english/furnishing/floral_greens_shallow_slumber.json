  "description": "This fluorescent plant, constantly budding but almost never blooming, displays an indigo coloring. They are commonly planted in pots of clean stone and can be found in research facilities such as Pardis Dhyai.\\nSome researchers will add special compounds to slow the growth of the plant into the soil, which allows them to study the fluorescence of the plant in greater detail. Hence, this plant seems to always be in a \"half-asleep\" state.",
