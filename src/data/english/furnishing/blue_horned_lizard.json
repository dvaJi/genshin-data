  "description": "A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.\\nThese lizards have beautiful blue scales and will break their tails off to escape when caught.\\nLizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.\\nOnce they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up. They will, for reasons unknown, also turn bright green. \\nThe lizards' severed tails grow back faster in the Realm Within thanks to the hospitable conditions within the Serenitea Pot.",
