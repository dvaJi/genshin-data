  "description": "A screen used on the stage of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe. It is, in fact, comprised of several screens connected to one another in sequence in such a way that they can block one's vision, while one of the screens serves as a hidden door, allowing characters to exit the stage during the course of a play. In some traditional pieces, there is a special order to how characters take and exit the stage, and depending on the atmosphere the play means to convey, some must leave discreetly. It is in such cases that these screens come into the picture, contributing to a smooth performance.",
