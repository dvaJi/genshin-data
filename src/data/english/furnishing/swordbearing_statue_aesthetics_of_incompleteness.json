  "description": "A stone statue of a sword-bearing soldier whose stance speaks of power and grandeur, as though extolling a hard-won victory for the ages. An imitation of the statues found in the Faded Castle.\\nIt is said that researchers once attempted to restore the broken left arm of the statue, seeking to fully and faithfully recreate how it would have appeared during the days of that bygone civilization, but all such attempts ended in utter failure, without exceptions. So things remained until an artist raised the critical question: \"What if this imperfect state is actually its perfect state?\" This crucial query not only caused them to cease their debates over this statue, but birthed a completely new idea â€” being incomplete is not the same as being imperfect, and within incompleteness can a unique aesthetic be found.",
