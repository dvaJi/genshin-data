  "description": "The Slate Umbrellafinch is a small, round bird in Fontaine that is distantly related to the finch. The umbrella in its name comes from its unique crest which looks like the head of a mushroom.\\nResearch indicates that the Slate Umbrellafinch possesses excellent physical capabilities that are belied by its appearance, allowing it to stay aloft for long periods without rest, while its slate feathers provide highly effective camouflage. Perhaps it's the similarity of their coloration or just poor eyesight, but they sometimes mistake Tubby for one of their own, only realizing their mistake after they've gotten quite close. They then turn tail and fly away, leaving Tubby alone and feeling very confused after being woken up by their sound.",
