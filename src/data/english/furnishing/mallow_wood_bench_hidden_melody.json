  "description": "A type of bench only found within Petrichor. Designed to provide a place of temporary respite for residents, it makes use of sturdy Mallow Wood, and though it lacks soft backing or cushions, it has enough space to provide ample comfort to all who use it. According to an unsigned report, this type of bench was the work of a certain master crafter of instruments, and whoever sits upon it will be able to hear a faint melody drifting by their ear.\\nHowever, according to research conducted by the Fontaine Research Institute, this is likely only a psychological effect caused by the bench's appearance, and has nothing to do with some mysterious property of the bench itself.",
