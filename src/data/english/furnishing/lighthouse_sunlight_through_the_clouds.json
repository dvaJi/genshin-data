  "description": "A model created in the likeness of the Lightkeepers' towering lighthouse. It stands, quiet but dignified, steady and reliable.\\n\"Surely, once the dark clouds disperse, sunlight will break through the clouds, and we will no longer see monsters emerge under the cover of night,\" said Captain Illuga. Perhaps only when that day truly comes can all the Ratniki finally lay down their arms, step outside the lighthouse, and enjoy a holiday bathed in warm sunlight.",
