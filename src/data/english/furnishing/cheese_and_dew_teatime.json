  "description": "A tea stall of unknown provenance, made from polished wood and adorned with a striking blue tablecloth. Each of the delicately crafted vessels in the stall seems to be of great import. Some emit a refreshing and sweet scent reminiscent of dewdrops, while others have a captivating rich aroma like fine cheese. The blue snack box offers a truly diverse selection of delectable morsels to accompany the drinks. Customers can choose to dine in or take them to go using vessels pre-attached strings, a considerate touch from the tea stall's designer.",
