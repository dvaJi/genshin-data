  "description": "A chirpy little bird, found in nooks and crannies all over Teyvat.\\nThis finch has feathers the color of blue-green gemstones and was, in fact, the very first bird in history to be used by miners as a \"caged finch.\" The reason was that its health status can be easily determined from how glossy its feathers are. As it happens, miners still take finches into the mines with them to this day, though they are no longer particular about the color of the plumage.\\nSome guests visiting The Realm Within will ask Tubby to confirm if she is a close relative of the Emerald Finch or not.",
