  "description": "Horn-shaped goblets, commonly seen in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, feature in various ancient legends as a symbol of a warrior. The pure brew it holds is considered the very essence of a warrior's spirit, embodying valor and fearlessness. Consequently, tradition in some regions of Natlan dictates that when one uses a horn goblet for toasting, one must empty its contents in a single gulp, just like a true warrior would.",
