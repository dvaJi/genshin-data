  "description": "A lovely species of grass that can be found near Sangonomiya Shrine. They grow vigorously when the snow melts in the early spring and are notable amongst people for their \"thrice-dyed crimson\" hue.\\nLike another plant species with a pinkish-red color, it is said to be related to the Divine Priestess. Some Watatsumi Islanders believe that each time the Divine Priestess prays for her people, one plant will be transformed to have this coloration by her power. As such, some of them will take the leaves of such plants with them as talismans, carrying them on their persons all the time.",
