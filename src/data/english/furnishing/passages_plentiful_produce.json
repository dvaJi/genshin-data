  "description": "A fruit and vegetable stall that can be found along the roadside of the Vasari Passage, often accompanied by grocery stores featuring metal and glass composite structures. It proudly showcases a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, many of which are imported from distant lands via maritime trade. Due to stringent regulations, restrictions, and some vendors' own consideration of maintaining a good reputation, the prices of these imported items are kept relatively low. Only a small additional shipping fee is applied, ensuring they are affordable for the general public.",
