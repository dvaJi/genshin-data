  "description": "A pallet of middling size that may be found in Caravan Ribat. It can hold somewhat less cargo than the usual sea cargo pallets, nor does it use hard crates but rather thick fabric to protect the cargo. However, there is a certain special coating at the base of such pallets that will allow strong hands to push it across the sands when not fully loaded, and its load is just right for Sumpter Beasts. In that sense, one could call this a highly scientific design indeed.",
