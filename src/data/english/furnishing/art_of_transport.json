  "description": "A trapezoidal woven basket, carefully crafted from resilient grass stalks. Its rim is fitted with specialized handles, making it exceptionally convenient to lift or drag. The basket's unique tapered design, being narrower at the top and wider at the base, serves two key purposes: Firstly, it lowers the center of gravity, ensuring stability and preventing it from falling over when being moved around. Secondly, its opening is sized to secure precisely three crops in place, preventing them from being shaken about and lost in transit.",
