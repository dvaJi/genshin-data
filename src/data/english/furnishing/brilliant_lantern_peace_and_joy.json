  "description": "A grand and gorgeous Xiao Lantern that vividly recreates the shape of the mighty Suanni that can be seen in the \"Just Wushou Dance!\" venue. If you carefully examine this auspicious beast-shaped Xiao Lantern, another sort of sense of security will rise in your heart. Perhaps this is the auspicious sight that inspired the legendary scene of \"peace and joy reigns, all evil retreats\" when the Suanni lifts its head.",
