  "description": "A double-layered tea rack made from reliable, economical Bamboo Segments and Fragrant Cedar Wood, often used to store the bamboo sieves that hold tea leaves.\\nOstensibly, this simply appears to be the three-layered rack in miniature and serves no additional functions. However, they say that this design can allow for a clearer view of the tea leaves. As such, Chunming Teaworks tends to use these as a display for new teas, allowing people who come by to inspect this year's tea leaves, and not just as a drying rack.",
