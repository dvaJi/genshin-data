  "description": "The intricately designed and beautifully crafted loom model is a scale replica of the Spiritloom used by Granny Itztli. Unfortunately, this model no longer possesses the functions of the original loom; it cannot produce fabrics or textiles, nor can it record Clairvoyant Shards like its prototype. It is said that these functions were removed because they were unnecessary and could affect the model's longevity. After all, in the Realm Within, when it comes to the efficiency of fabric production, no loom could possibly match Tubby's magical power.",
