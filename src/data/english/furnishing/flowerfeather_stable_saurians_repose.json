  "description": "A lavish stable supported by a \"Ashen Aratiku Wood\" frame, featuring a traditional sloped roof, primarily used to house Qucusaurs and Alpacas. The most unique feature of this structure is its movable door panel, carefully sized to prevent small Qucusaurs from escaping while ensuring that young children cannot open the door from outside, avoiding disturbances to the resting animals. For fully grown Qucusaurs, however, the door presents no obstacle â€” they can easily leap over it in or out, just as effortlessly as people come and go from their homes.",
