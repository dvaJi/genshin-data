  "description": "A streetlamp that can be seen out in Sumeru's wilds. This all began when researchers doing studies in the rainforest. Inspired by the Forest Rangers, they made improvements to normal torches. The researchers used a movable structure for the hanging point of the lamp's main body, such that even if the lamp pole was slanted, the lamp itself would remain perpendicular to the ground. This way, any fire hazard posed by flammable materials used would be decreased. This design was eventually adopted by normal streetlamps that used safe light sources and thus become the standard.",
