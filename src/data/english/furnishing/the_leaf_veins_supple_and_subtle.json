  "description": "\"These plants are often used by the people of Aaru Village to make soft fabrics. They may be used in an emergency if your clothes are damaged in an attack, say, by an Explosive Barrel.\"\\nThe latest edition of the matra manual has this to say concerning this species of desert shrub.\\nWhile the General Mahamatra's subordinates are quite flattered that he believes them capable of continuing their missions after being ambushed by an Explosive Barrel and having their clothes blasted to shreds... But in truth, they are all the more curious about the manual's content — following detailed investigations, they have concluded that no one from Amurta has lent the General Mahamatra any support in the past. As such, there must have been some other assisting hand from outside the Akademiya in the manual's creation for its botanical information to have become the equal of the \"Matra's Encyclopedia of Plants.\"",
