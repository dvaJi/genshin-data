  "description": "A coral that grows deep in the dark places of Enkanomiya. It has a strange and curious hue from root to stem and is almost crystalline in its transparency. A faint fluorescence is sealed within its branches almost as if it was affected by a certain power while witnessing the times when the white light shone. Unfortunately, these little lights cannot pierce the thick fog of darkness.",
