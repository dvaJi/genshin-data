  "description": "A standard shrub planted in the Court of Fontaine, it is a meticulously crafted, square-shaped plant. A feast for the eyes, it perfectly complements the architectural styles throughout the city, making it the first example listed in the Court of Fontaine Standards for Urban Decorative Plants. Rumor has it that gardeners capable of sculpting shrubs into such a shape will receive salaries on par with those of senior artisans. Of course, it is impossible to reach such a high standard without years of experience.",
