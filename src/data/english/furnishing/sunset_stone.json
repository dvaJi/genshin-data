  "description": "It is recorded in the \"Seven Mountain Treatises\" that Tianqiu Valley was once home to a mysterious kind of stone that would absorb the rosy hue of sunset after basking in it evening after evening over a long period. It became known as \"Sunset Stone.\" However, the claim has never been proven. Today, this term is used generally to refer to all manner of brown-colored stones.",
