  "description": "A Liyue-style store with wide windows. This design was popularized by the rise of Wanmin Restaurant.\\nPatrons can grab their food-to-go at the window or dine-in if they want, allowing the owner some flexibility.\\nEven if some head chef should use a little too much force and ignite the stove and the shelves, the wide passageways and water-diverting channels can be used to prevent the losses from getting worse.",
