  "description": "A carpet of exquisite workmanship with two shades of sunny orange as the main dye and painted with a unique style of geometric figures, an interior decoration common to Sumeru.\\nCarpets not only have a variety of lifestyle functions, but their shape and pattern are also important parts of Sumeru aesthetics. It is said that at the time when carpets were becoming very widespread, artisans tried to paint landscapes, birds, animals, and even respectable figures on carpets, but one researcher raised a crucial question - \"Isn't it inappropriate to trample on images of humans and beautiful things?\" Thus, none of those ideas came to fruition in the end, and the Akademiya instead decided on using geometric patterns for carpet patterns in order to strike a balance between aesthetics and intellectual connotations.",
