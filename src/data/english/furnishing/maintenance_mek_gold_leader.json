  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.\\nCompact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka groups, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\\nCompared to other mass-produced models, this special \"Gold Leader\" utilizes a clear gold outer casing along with special control equipment. The project team designed it to fulfill the role of a \"command relay station\" in particularly complex underwater environments, receiving and retransmitting commands from the controller to all other meka within the group, effectively fulfilling the important role of \"leader.\"\\nHowever, as the whole maintenance meka project stopped functioning, these \"leader meka\" lost their reason for existence. Only their highly recognizable clear golden casing gives them value in the eyes of the anglers who collect them.",
