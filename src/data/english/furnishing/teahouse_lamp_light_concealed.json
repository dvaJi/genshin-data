  "name": "Teahouse Lamp: Light Concealed",
  "description": "A light and exqusite little standing lamp that can be carried away and used whenever needed. After Komore Teahouse took this design up, it quickly became popular amongst the people. Its base has a detachable grid plate from which the candle can be retrieved and changed out. It even has a specific fixed mount for candles, such that the candle will not fall even if you run with this lamp in hand. Of course, this also means that it will not set the lampshade on fire, which makes it very safe indeed.",
