  "description": "A simple yet versatile wooden cabinet with well-organized compartments, well-suited for the temporary storage of alchemical potions and the arrangement of related books and manuals.\\nIt is said that alchemy, an art that is relatively poorly understood even in the present day, remains fraught with numerous variables in practice. The slightest deviation from established records can lead to unexpected results. Therefore, the furniture that alchemists use often emphasizes functionality and orderly compartmentalization in an attempt to eliminate unstable elements.",
