  "description": "Clusters of Padisarahs bloom in elegant flower hedges, their noble and pristine colors swaying in the wind. The Zubayr Theater only puts out these significant displays during important festivals and performances...\\nAccording to Paimon's description, Tubby did her best to recreate the shape of the flower hedges. Though these are not true Padisarahs, they are magnificent enough to make Paimon happy.",
