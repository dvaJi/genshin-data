  "description": "A simple wooden rack that can be found nigh everywhere in Chenyu Vale. It is made from Fragrant Cedar Wood that is as affordable as it is reliable. This type of wooden frame is not only robust and durable but simple enough that even those unskilled in woodworking can easily craft it. Due to these advantages, these racks are extremely popular with the residents of Chenyu Vale. It is not just used by tea farmers and merchants for drying, air-drying, or storing tea leaves, but some residents also make appropriate modifications, such that they may use it as a storage rack.",
