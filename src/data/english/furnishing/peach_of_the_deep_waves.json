  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.\\nThis medium-sized, round fish has horn-like cartilage that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters, and drive away creatures that try to harm it. \\nThis species' whole body is pink and the tail fin is green, colors that are associated with the Zaytun Peach. These fish are, as their name suggests, so sweet that they are considered \"suitable for dessert.\"\\nDoubtless, owing to various factors, the fish dessert that the fish chefs were hoping to create did not pan out. Because this type of fish is rare and expensive, it is often farmed as an ornamental fish. \\nThere is a large customer base that doesn't want to spend too much Mora on this kind of pufferfish, but nevertheless can't get enough of its bright colors. There are even enterprising businessmen who have managed to reverse this phenomenon, modeling their Zaytun Peaches after these pufferfish. The sales of those are pretty good.",
