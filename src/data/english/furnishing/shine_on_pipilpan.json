  "description": "A decorative figure fashioned from a performance costume, offered as a token of gratitude by \"Chiton.\"\\nPerhaps guided by her own heartfelt aspirations, \"Chiton\" chose an exceptionally difficult pose for this creation and imbued it with traits reminiscent of her father. Of course, a pair of spectacles still separates this piece from her paternal ideal, but may Chiton's spirit burn ever bright, and may she one day close that distance, becoming the radiant Pipilpan Idol she so admires.",
