  "description": "A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.\\nThese lizards have lovely red, patterned tails that blend in with their surroundings. They discard these tails in moments of peril to confuse their foes.\\nLizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.\\nOnce they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up.\\nUnlike those Green Horned Lizards that are terrified of birds, Red Tailed Lizards never avoid the two teapot spirits. Sometimes, Chubby even allows them to climb into his feathers because \"the horns on their heads do wonders for my itchy skin.\"",
