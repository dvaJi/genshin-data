  "description": "A simple grocery store that is very convenient to lay out and pack up. It only requires one umbrella to fend the wind and rain off, and is thus suited to doing roadside business.\\nMany of Liyue's rich today were once owners of such little stalls. They would cross the Stone Gate and do scattered business along the way, and it was them who opened up the trade route between Liyue and Mondstadt.",
