  "description": "A tall tree that grows in warm, moist climates and produces a fruit with a hard outer shell and sweet meat inside. Chefs often use this fruit to make drinks.\\nThe Silversand Coconut Tree's two trunks curve outwards, allowing both leafy tops to get ample sunlight and produce more fruit.\\nRecently, the Fatui have been paying a handsome sum to get their hands on the seeds of the Silversand Coconut Tree.
