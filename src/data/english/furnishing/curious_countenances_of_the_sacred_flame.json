  "description": "A common type of open-air stall in Chuwen Fair, primarily used for selling masks inspired by the various tribal cultures. Low overheads make it a popular choice among merchants. As seasonal goods, demand for masks peaks during festivals and competitions, while footfall dwindles in the off-season. To address this, mask vendors have introduced a service that allows customers to create their own masks, offering a novel \"experience\" that has itself become a sellable product â€” after all, it's not something they're used to experiencing in their everyday lives.",
