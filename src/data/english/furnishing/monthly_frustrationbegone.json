  "description": "Various bottles of alcoholic beverages stored in a wooden basket. Not only can you find local brands from Sumeru, but also various fruit alcohol types imported from Mondstadt, but most of these are rather expensive and do not sell in large numbers. Instead, they often wind up hoarded till they hit their expiration dates, before being packaged and sold at discounts. One can even shave a whole digit off the price this way.\\nUnfortunately, such events do not have fixed dates, and merchants and taverns usually run only one such promotion every month, so you have to watch for when such things might happen. It is said that there is a blond-haired guest who has managed to catch the discount every time, thus sparking a certain rumor amongst tavern patrons: If you see a blond-haired customer appearing near the tavern with a basket of wine, it means that the time for discounts has come!",
