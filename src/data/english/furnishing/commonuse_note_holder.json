  "description": "This type of note holder can often be found in Fontaine, and can be used to hang different types of notes or documents.\\nThe original specialized note holder was an incidental invention by a research group at the Fontaine Research Institute. The design's purpose was to accurately track the progress of various tasks. Therefore, the holder comes equipped with eight sections, divided along three different classification markers: \"completed or incomplete,\" \"important or not important,\" and \"urgent or not urgent.\" However, this \"standard\" note holder has proved too complex, since ordinary citizens generally do not categorize their notes in such detail. As a result, the \"universal\" or \"common-use\" type with only two sections has become a common sight in stores.",
