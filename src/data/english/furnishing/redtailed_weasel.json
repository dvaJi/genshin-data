  "description": "Prank-prone rascals with a slim and agile form.\\nThese weasels are red from head to toe and are highly proficient in hunting bugs and lizards. Red-Tailed Weasels are very visible, but many predators who fear fire keep their distance due to the similarity between the weasels' coloration and the flames of Pyro. In the Realm Within, where animals live in harmony, the intimidating color of the weasels coats has afforded them a higher status.",
