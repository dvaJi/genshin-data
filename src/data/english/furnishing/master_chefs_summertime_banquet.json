  "description": "A wooden sign whose maker remains unidentified. The cool colors on the poster stuck to it really stand out amidst the blazing-hot summer, making it exceedingly eye-catching and capable of greatly increasing a customer's appetite in the blink of an eye. The image even features a striking Cryo Slime that has triggered the endless imagination of gourmets:\\n\"If this restaurant had the Cryo Slime as the master chef, what would its signature dish be?\"\\nRound flatbreads, perhaps, or pizzas with special toppings?\\nAfter all, Slimes' figures are blessed by nature such that they can create perfect flatbreads simply by jumping and rolling on kitchen boards.\\nPerhaps this Slime master chef will even set strict rules for its apprentices, such as \"No matter how hard you jump and roll on the dough, your chef's hat must not fall on the chopping board!\"",
