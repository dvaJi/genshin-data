  "description": "A simple yet aesthetically pleasing medium-sized shelter built with a unique \"Flammabomb Wood\" frame, found within the Masters of the Night-Wind.\\nSome members of the tribe believe that allowing nature to take its course, without engaging in unnecessary interference, is the best way to preserve its true state. For this reason, the artisans who craft the wooden frames strive to preserve the natural shape of the branches, hoping that everything will develop as it should, following the path of nature.",
