  "description": "\"These plants are quite special indeed, and their leaves can be used as letter-paper on which to write. If you use this in concert with the previously-mentioned red dye, writing on these leaves with said dye, you can add a measure of secrecy to your writings, for the words will only emerge after being affected by Electro first, and then Dendro. As such, even if they mean to do so, the researchers of the Akademiya will not be able to gain knowledge of what is being communicated between one matra and another.\"\\nThe latest edition of the matra manual has this to say concerning this species of desert shrub.\\nIt is only when they reach this description that the matra understand why their superior has bypassed the researchers and amended their manual â€” if, one day, the matra were to meet with some great emergency, they would at least have a safe and secret way of communicating critical information to one another.",
