  "description": "A black colored avian.\\nThe black on its feathers are darker than the long nights of Teyvat. When many of them circle in the sky, they can create the illusion of a solar eclipse.\\nSome locals consider them inauspicious, while others consider them a symbol of good fortune. As the saying goes, that's how traditions work.\\nRumors abound among adventurers from various nations concerning a giant talking crow raised by a young female investigator from Mondstadt... Tubby does not think there is any need to be alarmed. \"Every animal has their own language, not just birds. Isn't it natural for intelligent beings to learn human language in turn?\"",
