  "description": "A hanging lamp that is widely used throughout the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. It features an external layer of Flammabomb Wood and a composite metal internal structure, such that durability can be balanced with lighter weight so that these lamps could be installed in all kinds of different places, no matter what the conditions.\\nThe terrain in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame is quite complex, and many of its narrow passages are not suited to placing large lamps. Taking this environment into account and scenarios in which audience members or contestants might get lost, the Speaker's Chamber tailored these lights to be installed in narrow spaces such that the Stadium might stay well-lit, and also to serve as road signs for the lost.",
