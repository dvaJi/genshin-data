  "description": "A traditional Inazuman hanging picture that displays the sunset reflected in flowing streams.\\nInazuma's traditionally used paints can be largely split into the \"Flower\" and \"Water\" types. Though \"flower\" paints have the word flower in them, they tend to really be extracted from derivatives of common plants, such as Lavender Melon skins. Of course, some high-class paints do use traditional flowers as their base material. The source of the latter comes from items such as underwater colored stone and fish scales. There is no real difference in the price ranges of the two different types. Instead, the artist will choose between the two styles based on their understanding of the work they are doing. And since this drawing's theme is about rivers and streams, then one must naturally turn to the \"water\" colors to set the scene.",
