  "description": "A common stall made from Karmaphala Wood, which has outstanding moisture-proofing properties. This stall is suitable for the sales of the freshest fruits and vegetables.\\nFruits and vegetables are typical time-sensitive commodities. The timing at which the fruits ripen and storage time greatly influence the fruit and vegetable business. \"Ensuring the effective flow of TSC (Time-Sensitive Commodities)\" is a research topic among Vahumana school's many social science studies. Based on relevant theories, Vahumana researchers have offered plenty of advice to fruit and vegetable vendors in the Grand Bazaar, which effectively reduces the extra consumption and inevitable waste of commodities, thus saving a considerable amount of Mora for vendors and even the Grand Bazaar in general.",
