  "description": "A model shield with defined edges, with Xudi having combined descriptions from ancient legends with things he has heard for its construction. It can be mounted on a \"Good Shelf\" for exhibition.\\nAccording to Xudi, this is the \"sturdiest shield,\" which can block any manner of attack without breaking. With its protection, even the most cowardly paper frog can find their courage. As such, it has gained the rather exaggerated name, \"Avatar of Valor.\"",
