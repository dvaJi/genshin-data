  "name": "Otogi \"Rakushi\" Square Stool",
  "description": "A light square stool made from Otogi Wood. Its construction is simple and it is easy to make, but it is also not all that long-lasting. Unlucky people might even destroy it all at once just by sitting down. At this time, it is common that the others present will all seat themselves directly on the ground as well, as if to help their unfortunate friend split the ill-luck for the day.",
