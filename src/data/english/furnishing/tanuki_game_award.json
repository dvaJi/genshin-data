  "description": "A beautifully crafted replica of the Tanuki Game Award, charming and lively, originally awarded to honor the team that created the \"best game\" at the \"Mikawa Flower Festival.\"\\nThough it is a replica, its casting was overseen by the same person as the original, and it was likewise created as a reward for the very best. Perhaps in the eyes of its creator, you, as the event's representative, have poured just as much heart and soul into the \"Mikawa Flower Festival\" as those who developed the games â€” so, just like them, you too deserve to be called \"the best\"!",
