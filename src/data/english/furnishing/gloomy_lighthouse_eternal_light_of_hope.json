  "name": "Gloomy Lighthouse: Eternal Light of Hope",
  "description": "A towering edifice built after a lighthouse that stands over a graveyard, crowned with a soaring spire.\\nThe living who remain have no need to light its beacon, for the restless shades linger, bound by oaths sworn in life. Hope and warmth are what the Lightkeepers wish to bring to Nod-Krai at any cost â€” no matter if the lighthouse burns bright or stands dark, no matter the circumstance. They remain steadfast to their vow: \"Our bones and blood we shall use as fuel, we shall make life greater than death.\"",
