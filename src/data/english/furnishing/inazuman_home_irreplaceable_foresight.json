  "description": "A compact two-story building that can be seen at key locations in Tatarasuna, While work is ongoing, the staff must continuously monitor the Mikage Furnace, and it is these very buildings that provide them with the vantage points needed for such observations. Usually, teams of two will conduct this monitoring in shifts, with one group resting upstairs while the others conduct their duty on the first floor.",
