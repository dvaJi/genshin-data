  "description": "\"The fish can hide in the cool water and the animals on the beach all have cooling shells.\"\\n\"But won't the furry, fluffy animals feel terrible in the summer?\"\\n\"It'd be great if we could make them an umbrella to cool down under!\"\\n...\\nBy the time the sun next blazed down upon Mondstadt, Klee had set just such an umbrella up, putting cat food under it. As expected, the cats did indeed come in their droves, enjoying the delicious food and the unique shade.\\nUnfortunately, the large gathering of cats also invites strife and the greatly increased density of cat fur in the air, even causing a certain bard's allergies to trigger... As such, Klee's great plans wound up being shelved.",
