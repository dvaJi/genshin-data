  "description": "A simple small tent constructed with fabric and a \"Ashen Aratiku Wood\" frame, frequently seen within the \"Scions of the Canopy.\" The most striking characteristics of this tent are its minimal setup difficulty and high reliability, allowing even young children to easily erect a stable temporary camp. As a result, its triangular design has become the standard solution for wind resistance among the \"Scions of the Canopy,\" with such tents being a common sight atop every building.",
