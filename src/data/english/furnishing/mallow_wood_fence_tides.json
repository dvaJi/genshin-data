  "description": "A very stylish Mallow Wood fence adorned with rippling waves. Not only is it quite attractive to look at it, but it also provides an excellent place to hang things from.\\nSome critics hold that this tall design extends the lifespan of the fence, avoiding damage from the unpredictable island weather. Some residents of Petrichor do not agree with that conclusion. In their opinion, the high waves are representations of the tides, having little to do with the weather.",
