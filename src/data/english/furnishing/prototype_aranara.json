  "description": "A wood carving that was once displayed outside Acara Crafts in Port Ormos. This was the prototype of their Aranara toy series, painstakingly crafted by artisans Fayez and Mamdouh, both of whom had never seen a real Aranara before but believed that these mythical creatures could bring joy and laughter to children. The Prototype Aranara was initially not very well-received, but thanks to storyteller Tanger's son Razi, the Traveler, and Paimon, the Acara Crafts staff successfully created Aranara carvings beloved by the children. This prototype was given to the Traveler and Paimon as a gift to express the artisans' gratitude.",
