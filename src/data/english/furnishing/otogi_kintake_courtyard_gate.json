  "description": "A village courtyard wall made from Otogi Wood.\\n\"Kintake\" is an old crafting technique that few people know. It involves grinding certain rarely-found wild grasses into powder before slow-boiling them into a special glue that can then be painted onto wooden lumber to give them a gloss and sturdiness similar to that of high-end overseas products such as Qingce Bamboo. Unfortunately, little research or record has been kept of this art, and it will soon become lost.",
