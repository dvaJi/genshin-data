  "description": "A standard two-story cottage in \"Easybreeze Holiday Resort,\" featuring a cat-eared rooftop that expands interior space while shielding from wind and rain â€” an ingenious dual function. Compared to other resort structures, it occupies a smaller space, has lower construction costs, and boasts an endearing appearance, making it ideal both as private housing or as a guest lodge.",
