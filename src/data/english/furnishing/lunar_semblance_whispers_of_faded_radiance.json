  "description": "An elegant statue modeled after the Lunar Semblances of the Frostmoon Scions. Its form is suffused with a soft lunar glow.\\nThe whispers of bygone days are sealed within its cold and silent frame, transmuted into serene moonlight. The statue cannot speak, and only those who earnestly seek the past may hear these murmurs of faded radiance. To Lauma, Moonchanter of the Frostmoon Scions, relics like these are repositories of untold wisdom, waiting only for the right seeker.",
