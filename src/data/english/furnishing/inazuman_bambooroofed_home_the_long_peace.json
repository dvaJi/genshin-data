  "description": "An Inazuman house that has utilized construction techniques from Konda Village to suit the local conditions. The cost of building this place is particularly low due to it being built with very common wood and boards. Still, the living conditions cannot be considered poor by any means, and indeed, it is even known to give people a strange sense of \"peace.\" Older folks enjoying their sunset years and open-minded people who care little for worldly affairs particularly love this place.",
