  "description": "A semi-open shop outfitted with a custom canopy and unique water feature, found within the \"Easybreeze Market.\"\\nIts most notable innovation is the outer wall, painted with a unique phlogiston pigment developed by an Asha designer. This pigment enhances the aroma of the café's brews with a subtle essence reminiscent of the Tenochtzitoc prairie. Thanks to its success, many other shops in \"Easybreeze Market\" have followed suit, embracing this artistic touch.",
