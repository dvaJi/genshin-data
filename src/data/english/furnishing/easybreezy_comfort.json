  "description": "A spacious mid-sized building commonly seen in \"Easybreeze Market,\" offering excellent living comfort.\\nDesigned for the region's intense heat, its thick walls fend off searing waves of warmth, while its tall, narrow windows minimize direct sunlight, keeping interiors pleasantly cool. Its exterior is adorned with vibrant Natlan-style murals, bursting with creativity and spirit, as if whispering the joy and vitality of this land through color.",
