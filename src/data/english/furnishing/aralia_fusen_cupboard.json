  "description": "A cupboard that may commonly be found in Inazuma. It is made from Aralia Wood that has been painted using deep colors, and is most often found in streetside food kiosks.\\nCompared with similar storage furnishings used in stores, the wood these cupboards are made from has been specially dried and their paint coatings are somewhat thinner, protecting them better against dust and oil smoke. It is said that these cupboards can see a decade of use without being visibly stained.",
