  "description": "A metal street light, oft to be found in the city of Mondstadt, upon which hangs a vertical flag.\\nThey say that the production of the poles thereof burned through a stockpile of metals built up over many years due to their use of solid metal, and created a lot of business for the blacksmiths.\\nWhich was just as well: with the Knights no longer venturing abroad often and the limitations of relying on selling weapons to adventurers for income, the life of a blacksmith can be quite tough.",
