  "description": "A common two-story shopfront in Nasha Town with excellent ventilation and natural lighting. The Vesnici Proleca Greenhouse is one such establishment.\\nTo maintain optimal lighting, temperature, and humidity for the flowers, florists often keep the doors shut. Even so, customers won't overlook these unassuming shops â€” the wafting fragrance draws them in of its own accord.",
