  "description": "A relatively common type of rock in the mountains of Natlan. These cairns are said to have been created by travelers of the past, who intentionally piled them up with rocks gathered along their way. The special inscriptions they bear seem to hold some deeper meaning, though their exact significance has since been lost to the sands of time. In the labyrinthine terrain of the mountain foothills, such cairns are highly conspicuous, so experienced couriers will memorize their locations as vital landmarks for navigation.",
