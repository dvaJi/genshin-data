  "description": "Porcelain jars that are normally seen in Deshret Desert. The main part presents a deep \"dark rock color,\" which is the product of the latest generation of desert pottery craft. The outer protective shell is said to be strong enough to withstand a blow from a hammer, and the jar protected by it would not shatter even if it fell from a high place. It is as strong as rock indeed, and therefore is ideal for storing things of value.\\nSome sellswords, however, went in the opposite direction, trying to place a protective shell inside a clay flask filled with explosives, using its ruggedness to create a lot of shrapnel and build a more potent explosive barrel. But due to high costs, they ultimately decided against it.",
