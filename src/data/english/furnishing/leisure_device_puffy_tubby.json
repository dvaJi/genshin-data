  "description": "An intricate mechanism that has been redesigned by Tubby. It has similar functionality to \"Allegro Bloom: Special Tuning\" and its color scheme has been changed to a bright blue and white palette. According to Tubby, though it might not be able to conserve adeptal energy, it is still slightly easier for her to create as porcelain is more familiar to her.\\nAfter hearing rumors about the Golden Apple Archipelago and obtaining the experimental samples of the Melodic Bloom, Tubby wondered how to set up more of these fantastical furnishings into the teapot. However, as she is also making a great many other fascinating mechanisms, combined with the complexity of the Puffy Tubby, the redesign could only be completed recently. It appears that even a teapot spirit has moments when they are overwhelmed...\\nWhen this furnishing is placed, it creates a continuous wind current.",
