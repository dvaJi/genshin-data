  "name": "Maple Wood Cornering Stairs",
  "description": "Maple Wood stairs built in a cornering style. The wood used in constructing this type of staircase has not yet been subjected to the traditional drying treatments. As such, they maintain just the right amount of moisture. It is said that a combination of this and the unique craftsmanship of its surfaces can lead to a soft texture when stepped on that can reduce the fatigue of climbing up and down the stairs.",
