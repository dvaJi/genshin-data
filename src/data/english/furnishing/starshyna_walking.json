  "description": "A large statue created in the likeness of a certain famous historical figure. The figure stands resolute, advancing with his sword drawn. Even those who pause to gaze upon it can perceive the determination and strength it conveys.\\nIt is said that, as the Lightkeepers' very first Starshyna, he once walked through the endless night for the sole purpose of keeping watch over the people, seeking only the first glimmer of dawn — a sign of hope for all.",
