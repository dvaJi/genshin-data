  "description": "A bow rack with two commonly used medium-sized bows that have a balanced size, draw weight, and combat utility. The arrows of recommended weight have a straighter trajectory, allowing even beginning bow learners to quickly adapt to its various characteristics. For experienced bow users, the bowstrings can be adjusted to adapt to heavier arrowheads for higher accuracy at longer ranges and greater impact.",
