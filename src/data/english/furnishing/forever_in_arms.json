  "description": "A massive torch constructed with a square stone pillar as its base and a circular metal brazier, used for illumination and navigation. It is one of the most iconic architectural elements within the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. The spiral patterns engraved on the pillar are thought to be simplified versions of Saurian graffiti. Perhaps the fact that such patterns have been engraved throughout all corners of the Stadium symbolizes the lifestyle shared by the people and Saurians of Natlan — living alongside each other, companions forever and always.",
