  "description": "A horizontal loom built into a wooden cart that had adopted a rather traditional design. It is used to weave fabric in larger sizes and has served as the cornerstone in Sumeru's textile industry for over 100 years. It is often used with a vertical loom to make up for its shortcomings in fabricating intricate patterns.\\nThough this machine is not yet perfect, its fundamental design is still one of the Kshahrewar school's vaunted research results and has spurred inspiration across disciplines â€” an architecture researcher once gazed at this loom while purchasing a custom-made carpet, saying \"If we set up facilities to manufacture and deliver materials first, such that we can 'weave' a house as if weaving a fabric...\" Well, of course, none know if the researcher ever put this concept into practice.",
