  "description": "An exquisite and lovely photo frame that contains a picture of the members of Musketeer Pictures. You obtained this memento after winning the Furina Award at the inaugural Fontinalia Film Festival thanks to the film \"The Two Musketeers.\"\\nArt has a romance all its own that can reflect the aspirations within peoples' hearts. As such, though the path was rather turbulent, you and your friends persevered â€” and now, you have a record of this happiest of endings to show for it.",
