  "description": "These crystalline pendulum-like lights resemble stars falling to the earth, just like the shining stars that can be found everywhere in the Temple of the Star Latitudes. A special powder is sealed within the clear glass that draws light from the environment and allows it to emit light for long periods of time.\\n\"Who can imprison starlight? All that will be left is shade.\"\\nThough she said this, the great astrologist seemed to not wish for this lamp to go out, and may have left this one behind in her temporary apartment as a memento.",
