  "description": "The likeness of Paimon, as drawn by Albedo. Strikingly lifelike and featuring exquisite brushwork, the overall look of this image is brilliant indeed. Albedo sought Paimon's opinion in coming up with the full, proper name for this work: \"A Portrait of the Traveler's Dear and Paramount Companion, Top Gourmet, and Teyvat's Number One Guide, Paimon.\" Unfortunately, Paimon herself cannot remember this name, and so it has been truncated to \"A Portrait of Paimon, the Greatest Companion.\"",
