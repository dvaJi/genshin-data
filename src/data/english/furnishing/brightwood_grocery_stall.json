  "description": "An open-air store made from a Brightwood frame and a delicately-patterned cloth ceiling with dimensions that are just right. The tabletop and goods storage look quite ordinary, but their measurements have been very carefully calculated such that many different products can be displayed to customers at the best possible angle. As such, this sort of store can have many functions, thus giving it the reputation of being an \"all-purpose store.\"",
