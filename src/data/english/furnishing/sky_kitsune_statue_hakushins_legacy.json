  "description": "Sky Kitsune statues that are scattered throughout Inazuma.\\nSome legends hold that Sky Kitsune statues have the power to cleanse evil spirits, while others claim that they defend important wards. The two that stand guard on either side of the Sacred Sakura at the Grand Narukami Shrine are particularly austere, and it is said that if those who come to pray have particularly sensitive souls, they can even hear the statues whispering.\\nThat said, the shrine maiden Kano Nana has explained in the past that Guuji Yae does not wish for people to come before these sculptures with heavy hearts, and that she would like for people to behave normally before the statues and embrace more light-hearted tales, like the ones that claim that \"the kitsune statues come alive at night, and keep watch over the steps of timid children traveling in the night.\"\\nAfter all, \"Is it not the wish of those who have passed on that we who live now should do so without pain?\"",
