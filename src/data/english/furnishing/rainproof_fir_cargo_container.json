  "description": "A sturdy fir container that has had a waterproof fabric draped over it to keep the inside dry.\\nThese containers have sizable capacities and can store large cargo, though this comes at the cost of a shocking weight that will take several people to transport.\\nSome say that some of these containers can be locked on the inside, all the better for workers on the move to hide in and stay safe should they be attacked by monsters.",
