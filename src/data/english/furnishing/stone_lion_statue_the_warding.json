  "description": "A stone lion statue that is used to ward off evil spirits. This stone lion defends the right-hand side.\\nLegend has it that the first stone lions were built from jade and based on the forms of adepti. Their ability to frighten evil away has made them very popular throughout Liyue, and a notable example is the two stone lions that stand guard on either side of the main gate of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.\\nMost people treat these statues with the utmost respect, but the Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor seems happy to disregard this tradition, regularly showing up around them to play some pranks.",
