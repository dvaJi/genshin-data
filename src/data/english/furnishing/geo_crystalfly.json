  "description": "Pure elemental life-forms composed of drifting Geo particles, as free and unbound as the butterflies they resemble.\\nA glittering Geo creature that is the product of rising and condensing elements, and which feeds off the ubiquitous power of Geo.\\nIn antediluvian ages, even rocks could dream. They say that these crystallized flying butterflies are those very dreams the mountains had. Perhaps after hovering over the sky suffused with Sub-Space Creation energies for a long time, their posture will assume the form of pens and knives, etching these shadowed dreams into the Serenitea Pot.",
