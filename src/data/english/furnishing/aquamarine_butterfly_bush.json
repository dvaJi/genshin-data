  "description": "A shrub that thrives in the wilds of Fontaine. Its aquamarine blooms resemble fluttering butterflies when viewed from the side.\\nDefining colors and studying the properties of light is the responsibility of a research group at the Fontaine Research Institute. Its researchers often engaged in prolonged debates with painters and photographers about the definitions of aquamarine and oceanic blue. The debate caused delays in other projects, eventually resulting in a compromise in which the definition of colors within the blue spectrum were significantly broadened. It serves as a reminder to newcomers that getting too caught up in trivial semantic debates is a waste of time.",
