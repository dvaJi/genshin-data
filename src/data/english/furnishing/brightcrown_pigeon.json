  "description": "A common avian species in Teyvat. Plump and meaty, but can also be trained to deliver messages.\\nAn ordinary pigeon that takes its name from its glaze-like glossy neck. Because it is such a common sight to both people and animals alike, few take much note of its gorgeous plumage. Even when they land on the backs of Forest Boars, the heads of Snow Foxes, or next to Frogs, no one seems to notice them.",
