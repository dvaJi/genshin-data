As such, praying at these shrines is regarded by some as the most important of rituals. Thus, they will come forth while wearing and looking their best, having made most careful preparations.\\nAs for the valiant and loyal servants of the Shogunate, these shrines also serve as a warning that they must always bear the Almighty Shogun's ideals in mind, and be prepared to sacrifice their all for the cause.",
