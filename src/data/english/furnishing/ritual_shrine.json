Thus, they will come forth while wearing and looking their best, having made most careful preparations.\\nAs for the valiant and loyal servants of the Shogunate, these shrines also serve as a warning that they must always bear the Almighty Shogun's ideals in mind, and be prepared to sacrifice their all for the cause.",
