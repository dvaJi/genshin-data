They can be found in the forest and in the wilderness, occasionally accompanied by other bright flowers.\\nLarge amounts of luminescent materials can be extracted from these plants, and the liquid from its stem and leaves can also emit a pure light when catalyzed by other substances. Unfortunately, these extracts cannot be stored for a long time, and usually need to be carefully mixed before being used.",
