  "name": "Three-Wheeled Mountain Hand Cart",
  "description": "This uniquely shaped cart has two sets of wheels varying in size. When operated by an experienced delivery worker, the cart can easily navigate across uneven terrain by taking advantage of the size difference between its wheels. Thus, these carts are also called \"Mountain\" carts. The only downside is that due to their limited carrying capacity, they can't be used for transporting heavier goods.",
