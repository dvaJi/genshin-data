  "name": "\"Tolling of the Musicmaking Town\"",
  "description": "A clocktower constructed of a combination of wood and stone that can be found in Petrichor and which contains a large, exquisitely crafted metal bell whose tolling announces the time to the entire town. In addition, a weathervane that shows the direction and strength of the wind is installed on the very top. Rumor holds that skilled bellringers can combine changes in windspeed with meteorological conditions to predict the weather within a certain range, and ring out alarms warning the residents of imminent storms at the right time.",
