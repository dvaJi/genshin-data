  "description": "An expertly designed Inazuman dwelling that can be found in Bourou Village. Watatsumi Island's terrain is quite unique and its moisture is comparatively high. With Bourou Village being beneath sea level, the curious sea winds often blow about it, bringing vapor spray and foam as they pass through. To prevent the insides of buildings from getting too humid, these structures use a lightweight double-layered wall and special window papering, with the planks and paper being coated in a product of boiled fish scales, which has granted it unmatched moisture resistance. Even when it pours like a veritable waterfall, the house can be kept dry as per normal.",
