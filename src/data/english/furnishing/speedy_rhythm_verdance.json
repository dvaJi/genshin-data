  "description": "This combination of furnishings was created by Tubby herself, and it is made from the Scoreboard and Flash Step components, decorated in a lovely shade of verdant. After stepping on different Flash Steps, the lamps on the Scoreboard will light up one by one and the corresponding score will be recorded.\\nCombine these mechanisms with the Realm Within's various furnishings to form all sorts of time attack tracks.\\nTubby mentioned that Travelers sometimes need to set multiple nodes on their routes to accurately control the pace of their adventures; and sometimes they need to drive innocent critters to designated locations to prevent them from being caught in the battle. With this combination of furnishings provided by Tubby, you can easily carry out the above training in the Realm Within, and even play \"cat racing,\" \"dog racing,\" and \"boar racing\" games with your friends.",
