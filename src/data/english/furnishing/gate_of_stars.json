  "description": "An ornamental metal door creatively utilizing decorative clockwork elements as ornamentation. It is of the same design as the metal gate within the Astral Garden.\\nAccording to legend, before embarking on the Aerial Express to the stars, every resident of Constellation Metropole tasked with maintaining the starry sky would need to symbolically pass through this gate before going to the train platform. However, with the slow passing of time, that train which once traversed the starry firmament has not set out for over a century, and no more footsteps ring out from beneath it. Even so, this door remains along with the gift from the Goddess of Prophecy, silently guarding the fate of Constellation Metropole.",
