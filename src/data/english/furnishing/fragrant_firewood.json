  "description": "In Natlan, trees tend not to be named for their appearance, but according to the ways in which their wood is normally used.\\nFire plays an immensely significant role in Natlan's society, serving not only as a basic light source, but also as a spiritual symbol of profound import. Maintaining an indoor flame has become a daily necessity, requiring fuel that is readily available, safe to burn, and produces minimal smoke for an easier cleanup. Low-lying, yellow-crowned shrubs, widespread across Natlan, fit this role perfectly. Their relatively dry trunks ignite easily and emit a subtle fragrance with natural aromatherapeutic effects when burned, earning them the nickname \"Fragrant Firewood.\"",
