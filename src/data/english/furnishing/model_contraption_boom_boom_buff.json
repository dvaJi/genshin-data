  "description": "An intricately constructed model of a sound amplification device, the prototype is fitted with three units for amplifying sound which can be connected to a record player to boost its volume. Commonly seen in the People of the Springs. Music needs to be played at a sufficient volume for a listener to appreciate all its intricacies, which would otherwise go unheard. Therefore, the artisans of the People of the Springs developed this amplification unit based on mysterious old mechanisms. The owner of Djembe Studios designed a lightweight model for out-of-town visitors to keep as a souvenir of their travels.",
