  "description": "A lush and lovely sakura that is known for shining bluish-black under the moonlight. Its light fragrance is particularly unique, and often wafts over to the distant sea or sky. In nights where no people walk, birds will perch themselves upon this sakura's branches and use it as a peaceful place of repose. Who knows where the wanderer who gave this tree its nickname is now?",
