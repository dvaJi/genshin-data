As such, these \"gentlemen\" pay close attention to proper etiquette and maintain an appropriate distance from strangers. Any sudden movements towards them will only cause them to promptly take flight.\\nPaimon once asked Tubby if he'd ever been able to catch one. Paimon explained that she meant no harm with her question, but still Tubby refused to answer.",
