  "description": "A sofa with softness beyond compare. Masked in cheerful hues and offering extreme comfort when sat upon, this sofa will dissolve one's exhaustion in little time.\\nThis sofa was originally a piece of furniture procured for Diona. Margaret intended for the bartender to have a place to rest after work to stay healthy and in good spirits. However, the labor of mixing drinks itself is a trifling thing altogether for Diona. The main woes of her profession originate more from the stink and drunkenness of the patrons. Moreover, every time she naps on this sofa, the duel cats would come over and snuggle up to her, leaving her coated with hard-to-clean cat hairs. Ultimately, this caused Diona to use the sofa less and less, with it eventually \"seized\" more by customers and card players alike.",
