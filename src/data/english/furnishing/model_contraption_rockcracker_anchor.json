  "description": "A complex metal model which is a scaled-down model of a certain Pneumousia Energy Supply Device. It is akin to its original in most ways, save for the ability to actually supply energy.\\nSuch devices sometimes must be placed on rather unique terrain, and engineers have thus equipped them with special anchors to fix them in place. This model was made in imitation of just one particular type of such machine, with a set of Pneumousia-powered anchoring hooks being built into its base, allowing it to, as the name \"Rockcracker\" suggests, break into and hold onto any ground it needs to.\\nOne thing to note is that once it has anchored itself in place, it no longer needs any Pneumousia machines to keep it in place. As such, issues such as \"what to do when the Pneumousia-powered anchoring device no longer has any Pneumousia to power it\" will not arise.",
