  "description": "These exquisitely crafted tanuki dolls look like clay lacquerware at first glance. In fact, this doll is actually made with a carefully crafted wooden skeleton covered with fabric and painted with special colored lacquer. The dolls made with this technique are light, strong,and cheap. They are of good quality and sturdy while still available at a low price.",
