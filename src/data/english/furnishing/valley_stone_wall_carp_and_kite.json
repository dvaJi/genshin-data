  "description": "A kind of low stone wall that can be found in Yilong Wharf, it earned the name \"Carp and Kite\" due to its shape resembling the body of a carp and the tail feathers of a kite.\\nIt is said that due to the special shape of this low, decorative wall, stonemasons prefer to build them near the water at the feet of mountains, to give the impression of \"fish entering the sea and birds flying into the sky.\" This sense of freedom adds a sense of liveliness and energy to the courtyard. Of course, if a line of fresh greenery can be planted beside it, the landscape effect would be even more ideal.",
