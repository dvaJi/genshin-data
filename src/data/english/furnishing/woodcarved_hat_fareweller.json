  "description": "A wood-carved hat adorned with a plum blossom that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the hat of an eccentric, quirky girl in Liyue Harbor. A storyteller once created many stories involving the subject of death, but they all ended up being detested by parents. \"Death is too heavy a topic for children,\" they say. \"My fairy tales are created for the children who have to face death in reality.\" Unfaltered, the author maintained their stance. Thus, these somewhat special Farewellers came to exist in Aranara fairy tales.",
