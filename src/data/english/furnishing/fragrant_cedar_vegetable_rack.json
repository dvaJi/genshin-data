  "description": "A tall stack of shelves built from Fragrant Cedar. This shelf rack can store a great number of items, and is typically found in the kitchens of busy inns and restaurants as well as the estates of wealthy families.\\nEach shelf can bear a good amount of weight, but firsthand user experience suggests it is not wise to put large items on the very top shelf. Especially not, say, a full-bellied Guoba.",
