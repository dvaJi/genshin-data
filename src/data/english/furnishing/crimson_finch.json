  "description": "A chirpy little bird, found in nooks and crannies all over Teyvat.\\nThis bird sports bright-red feathers, helping it to put on a dazzling show when mating season comes around. Unfortunately, this same bright plumage also makes it an easy target for hunters. The dainty little Crimson Finch is one of the main food sources for carnivorous animals in Teyvat. Fortunately for them, The Realm Within is a safe haven where they don't have to worry about their striking feathers.",
