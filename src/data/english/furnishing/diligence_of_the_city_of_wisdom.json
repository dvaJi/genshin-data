  "description": "An ordinary wooden house often found to the west of Sumeru City. It is structurally similar to the buildings in Vimara Village. Thanks to the building materials' properties, the interior of such houses is usually quite dry, suitable for storing grain and herb seeds. Therefore, prudent and efficient farmers like to build these houses around fields, both to live in and to support their long days in the field.",
