  "description": "A type of long couch found in Sumeru. Designed with lengthy pillows, this couch allows people to eat their meals while seated on the side or even lay down to rest. One can even place a small table upon the couch and sit cross-legged while enjoying a good time with friends and guests. Theoretically, this furniture item should offer substantial convenience, but researchers have discovered that people have a habit of laying down after eating â€” a habit most detrimental to one's health. As such, researchers recommended reducing the availability of these couches, and they are now becoming rare and few. In some establishments, these couches might also be used as a small stage for their instruments.",
