  "description": "An annex to the Refined Estate that can be used to receive guests.\\nSome Inazumans who place great emphasis on mercantile etiquette will choose their dealings with great care, doing their best to avoid giving any offense to others. If one is not all that close to someone else, it may not be advisable to visit the other party's residence directly, but to discuss matters in another spot in their courtyard. These reception areas come in most handy in such situations.",
