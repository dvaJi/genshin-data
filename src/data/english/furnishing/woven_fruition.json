  "description": "A stall where carpets, tapestries, and finished fabrics are displayed for sale. Such stalls are often seen in many stores in the Grand Bazaar. Diverse textiles of rich patterns and beautiful colors fascinate tourists and trigger a bulk-purchase impulse. Thanks to the popularization of weaving machinery techniques, quality carpets can be seen in almost every Sumeru household. Carpets have also become an important part of interior design in Sumeru, and the academic discussions surrounding them are legion — such as pattern design in aesthetics studies and dyeing material enhancement in chemistry studies, and overviews on the development of the textile industry and weaving machinery. Once, a self-claimed \"senior\" researcher in machinery even had an intense academic argument with an architecture researcher over a related discussion in front of a textile stall. Their argument ended up with both sides \"agreeing to disagree,\" which was later deemed as a classic example of \"rational discussion\" between researchers.",
