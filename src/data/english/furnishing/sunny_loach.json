  "description": "The legendary freshwater amphibian that can spit out pearls. They are found mostly where the water is clear and the reeds grow long.\\nThey are the color of a lovely, clear day, and meeting one might mean that you might have a lucky day as well.\\nThey will combine elements that can neither be absorbed nor digested, gravel and ores within their bodies to create sparkling, shining pearls, and will spit them out when threatened to confuse and distract predators. \\nSome playful Sunny Loaches are said to toss their pearls down hillsides to mess with the less friendly crabs in the diverse landscape of the Realm Within.",
