  "description": "A walkway that can be found within the Kanjou Commission Headquarters.\\nIt is said that the Kanjou Commission once planned to build such walkways into every corner of Ritou. This way, the Hiiragi Clan Head might take a stroll in their gardens and thus survey the whole island.\\nHowever, the arrival of certain outlander guests has caused the Kanjou Commission to decide to store a great sum of funds and direct them towards more proper avenues â€” this plan was duly scrapped as a result.",
