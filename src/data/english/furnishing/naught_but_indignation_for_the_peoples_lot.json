  "description": "The impressive, imposing, solemn, and majestic Mingxiao Lantern is said to have been made in memory of a certain yaksha. The ape-like yaksha in the lantern is wearing a mask of wrath and rage, with the power to subdue all demons, regardless of from whence they come. After the lantern is lit, its majesty and power reach new heights. Not only can it bless those who see it, but it also protects the tranquility of Liyue Harbor. If you look closely at this lantern, an impression of its elegance will linger on in your thoughts.",
