  "description": "A humanoid figurine who has been restrained, vividly recreating the Constellation Metropole citizenry when stuck with superglue. Can be placed on a \"Good Shelf\" for display.\\nBesides its normal adhesive functions, superglue is occasionally used as a movement restrictor. However, regardless of the situation in which such glue is used, one must be careful with one's footing. Even a slight misstep could see one wind up just like the model.",
