  "description": "The standard chandelier set of the Illusory Annex consists of a large central main lamp and secondary lamps arranged in a circular fashion around it. It resembles an elegant floral crown, and the color, temperature, and lamp wick intensity create a comfortable atmosphere, resulting in soft overall lighting.\\nA opera singer once remarked that this lamp's brilliance was \"akin to being underwater, gazing at the sunlight filtering through the clouds at three in the afternoon.\"\\nHowever, considering the age and diving skills of this performer, the reliability of such descriptions is an open question.",
