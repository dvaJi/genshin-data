  "description": "A round carpet with water-blue suede and a golden, symmetrical pattern found in hotels within the Court of Fontaine. The carpet's pattern is said to have yielded extraordinary results during a particularly tricky business negotiation. Its designer divided the carpet into eight segments with exactly equal dimensions. This ensured the area in which each of the four participants was seated felt identical, and prevented them from influencing one another. Along with the peaceful conclusion of the negotiations, the practice of using a circle divided into eight equal segments as a metaphor for equality started to spread as well, until finally, it could be seen in any venue where business negotiations are often held.",
