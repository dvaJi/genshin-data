  "description": "A coastal tree species known for its straight trunk and vivid canopy, with broad, sweeping leaves concentrated at the top. Unlike other palms, the multicolored variety seldom bears fruit, allowing it to grow freely across sandy shores without attracting climbers.\\n\"Terrible coconut juice â€” no sane person would enjoy it,\" remarked one soul brave enough to taste its rare harvest.",
