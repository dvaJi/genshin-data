The \"Launch Tube\" is filled with fireworks beads carefully pre-made by craftsmen and can be set off with a simple operation.\\nThe Queen of the Summer Festival of Hanamizaka once said to the children, \"The fireworks in the Launch Tube are still sleeping. Only when you wake them up at the right time, will they perform a beautiful dance for everyone.\" After hearing the words of the Queen of the Summer Festival, the children restrained their playfulness and never let off all the fireworks before the festival.",
