  "description": "A wood and stone hybrid residence with an independent work area, observable within the \"Children of Echoes.\"\\nIt is said that due to the region's rich mineral resources, nearly every resident has mastered the skills of an artisan, making home workshops quite prevalent. Consequently, when constructing houses, people habitually plan a semi-open space for potential future workshop modifications. Over time, builders have come to value the potential for expanding their homes more than merely their living functions, thus bestowing this architectural style with the name \"Standard Workshop.\"",
