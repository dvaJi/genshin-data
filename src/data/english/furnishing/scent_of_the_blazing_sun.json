  "description": "A basket that can often be found in Aaru Village. It is made using dried bark and rattan, and is both simple and durable, making it the perfect tool for drying plants, fruits, and flowers.\\nSome locals believe that the searing sun of the desert can add unique flavors to food and spices, \"engraving the sun's passion upon them,\" or so it is said, thus granting them some special traits not seen elsewhere. This view has been acknowledged by some gourmets and collectors, and is currently being pushed into the mainstream.",
