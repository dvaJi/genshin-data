  "description": "A magnificent and glorious fountain modeled the same style as the immense fountain in the square in front of the Opera Epiclese. It has a total of four tiers, and each level is adorned with beautiful metallic decorations.\\nIt is said that the designer compared the dazzling water glistening beneath the sunlight to the kind and elegant citizens of Fontaine, while each of the important institutions of Fontaine are embodied by the majestic beasts seated on the sides of the fountain. They remain ever-vigilant to pass judgment and expel both stains and sin from this immaculate and pure country.",
