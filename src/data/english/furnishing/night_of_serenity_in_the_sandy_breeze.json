  "description": "A semi-permanent tent with a very special structure. Though it may seem light, its foundation is actually rooted deep underground, making it extremely stable. Compact tents like this are unique to the desert region, and they provide adequate shelter from sandstorms. It is said that the thickness of the fabric has been fine-tuned to help experienced desert dwellers determine the strength of the wind and predict the weather through the sound of sand grains brushing past.",
