  "description": "Inexpensive and durable crates made of Mallow Wood boards and metal. As with most things made in the Fortress of Meropide, they have a rugged exterior and are highly durable. Although these crates do not conform to the typical Fontainian aesthetic, their ability to accommodate the large volume and weight of clockwork meka has earned them favor with many clients.",
