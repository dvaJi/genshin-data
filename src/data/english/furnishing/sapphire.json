  "description": "An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.\\nThese pure white kitty cats are named and famed for their shining sapphire-blue eyes. But no matter how lovely Sapphires may be, they also have terrible tempers. One must take care to have some fish jerky — and some balm for superficial cuts — handy when hanging out with them. But somehow, in ways unknown to anyone, the soft-hearted Tubby managed to command their obedience and respect.",
