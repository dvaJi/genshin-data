  "description": "A cleverly designed Inazuman street lamp that was made out of carefully carved Otogi Wood.\\nIt is said that the swirling sounds of thunder will remain on this lamp, thus displaying the Raiden Shogun's might. But according to the old folks, this legend originates from the original artisan who designed these lamps having a brainwave and combining the concepts of \"the Eternal Narukami\" and \"everlasting lightning\" in its name, and has no deeper significance.",
