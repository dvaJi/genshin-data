  "description": "An anemometer made from \"Ashen Aratiku Wood\" paired with a conical cloth bag, primarily used to help people monitor wind speed and direction in real time. It is a unique device of the Flower-Feather Clan.\\nIt is said that although this cloth-based anemometer is not as precise as propeller-style ones, its low cost and intuitive design make it a favorite. Even a Saurian rider flying high in the sky can judge the approximate wind speed and direction on the ground with a single glance, as if grasping the very tail of the mountain wind.",
