  "description": "An elegant furnishing crafted out of flawless white porcelain. It seems to have evolved from an age-old Liyue instrument, like a manifestation of a thousand celestial larks. This furnishing can reproduce melodious tunes, restore each delicate note, and let the music drift with the wind to every corner of the Realm Within.\\nLong before the Archon War, music became an essential part of people's lives: uplifting songs were sung during hard work; solemn music was played during important ceremonies; the battle cry of drums before going to war... Some adepti would record the melodies circulating around Liyue and enjoy them quietly in the Realm Within. Some friendly guests would bring music from neighboring countries so that the adepti could savor the songs of the people when they lived in seclusion.",
