  "description": "An open, broad structure that combines a blue-toned glass dome and a golden frame for an elegant and bright look. The green tiles and the gray-white stones below give the common folk of Sumeru a genial impression, such that some researchers have called the two structural features the symbols of a \"noble soul\" and a \"humble form\" respectively. Though the original intent of such structures is unknown, researchers very much enjoy resting within them to calm themselves and ponder questions.",
