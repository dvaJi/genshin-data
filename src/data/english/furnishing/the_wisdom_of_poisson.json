  "description": "These large residences built from repurposed bows and cabins of multiple abandoned ships can be found in Poisson. It is said that some residents of Fontaine, particularly those who strongly believe in apocalyptic theories, find Poisson's design astonishing. In their eyes, these dwellings, which can serve as regular residences and might transform into boats when the water rises, are incredibly convenient. Unfortunately, these homes made by converting discarded vessels are just a last resort in times of extreme scarcity and do not function as seamlessly as outsiders might imagine.",
