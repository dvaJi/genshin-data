  "description": "A street lamp made from the lightweight \"Ashen Aratiku Wood,\" commonly seen in the wilds surrounding the \"Scions of the Canopy,\" featuring an unprocessed wooden post and secured with simple ropes. This design was intended to cope with the extremely rugged terrain around the \"Scions of the Canopy,\" allowing craftsmen to carry minimal weight and use local materials for lamp construction and repair, thus greatly reducing maintenance labor costs.",
