  "description": "A device that is made from three circular rings. When used as a piece of experimental apparatus, the three rings can all rotate to indicate the corresponding position of specific stars. According to a certain librarian, the rule scale present on the instrument can be adjusted to allow it to incorporate a map, thus allowing it to analyze its target in three-dimensional space. It might even be used for complex time planning or to assist in some special calculations...\\nThis device also makes for a lovely table decoration. For display purposes, however, the rings are locked and will not rotate. It is said that the reason for this modification was the predilection of some to enjoy watching the rings spinning at high speeds, which has resulted in some accidents, such as the structure collapsing, sending the rings flying out to hit and injure a cat on the roof...\\nAs such, a \"safety first\" approach was adopted with regard to this furnishing.",
