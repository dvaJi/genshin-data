  "description": "A modest four-legged wooden platform, entirely constructed from high-quality \"Ashen Aratiku Wood,\" found in the Flower-Feather Clan. It is no exaggeration to say that nearly the entire tribe is built on a complex network of platforms and walkways. If balloons are seen as the wings that lift the Flower-Feather Clan into the skies, then these wooden platforms might be considered the \"giant claws\" that anchor the tribe to the mountains.",
