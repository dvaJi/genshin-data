  "description": "A slender, amphibious fish that has the peculiar habit of warming itself up at shallows or sandbanks.\\nYoung unagi tend to be transparent throughout, and will only gain their beautiful vermillion ear-fins and red-and-yellow splotches as they mature. Apart from being used as high-end ingredients, they are also often kept as ornamental fish. \\nBecause of their gentle nature, Unagi can live in harmony with all the creatures in the Realm Within, making them some of Tubby's favorite companions.",
