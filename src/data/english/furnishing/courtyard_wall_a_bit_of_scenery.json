  "description": "The courtyard walls of the Illusory Annex feature meticulously crafted fountain-shaped railings, with the gaps between railings cleverly designed to form a \"visual funnel,\" showcasing a corner of the courtyard's scenery. It is said that Fontainians view the cleanliness and beauty of the courtyard at home as a reflection of the quality of their life. Therefore, Fontainians are keen on using such semi-open railings to showcase the scenery of their own courtyards to others. Of course, if one wishes to enter and see the whole view, they must first receive an invitation from the homeowner.",
