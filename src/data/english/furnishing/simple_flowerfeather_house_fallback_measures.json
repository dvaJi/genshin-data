  "description": "A standard small independent building within the Flower-Feather Clan, constructed with a double-layered \"Ashen Aratiku Wood\" frame and durable fabric. It is said that, while the Scions of the Canopy view their buildings as \"camps for exploration,\" the Flower-Feather Clan sees theirs as \"bases for combat and training.\" As such, their buildings are designed with a double-layered structure similar to a balloon. The outer fabric is made of fabric that maintains the shape, while internal air pockets provide additional buoyancy. This design reduces the weight burden on wooden platforms and allows the houses to be quickly transformed into balloons, augmenting their aerial capabilities in times of war.",
