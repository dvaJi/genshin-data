  "description": "A Pearbell with flowers that almost seem to glow. It tends to be a very suitable hiding spot for fireflies, and when one hides in its petals and gives off light, these flowers really do become \"fluorescent lamps.\" If you do wish to use this for lighting, you'll probably need a few more pots of it... and you'll need to catch some more fireflies while you're at it, too.",
