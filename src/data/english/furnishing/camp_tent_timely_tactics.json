  "description": "A military officer's tent like the ones seen in the Kujou Encampment. The interior of such dwellings is very spacious indeed.\\nIn the Teyvat Art of War printed by Yae Publishing House, such tents are mentioned to have new sand table models within that are specially designed by the Tenryou Commission. These can be used to reproduce all available battlefield information and are accurate up to the last known position of every last Pale Red Crab. That said, unauthorized personnel are never allowed into such tents, nor do the officers themselves speak a word about the sand tables. And considering how the Shogunate and Resistance forces remain locked in a stalemate, it does not seem like such information is that reliable.",
