  "description": "A pair of melancholic wood-carved eyes that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the eyes of the sculptor Mamdouh at Acara Crafts. With everyone's help, a variety of carving components are now in stock. However, Mamdouh is still concerned about the sales of the carvings. Razi somehow finds his distressed expression quite appealing, and a pair of concerned eyes were thus replicated.",
