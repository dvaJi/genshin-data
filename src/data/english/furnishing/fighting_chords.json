  "description": "A guitar-shaped shop sign crafted from solid White Chestnut Oak Wood, identical in style to the emblem of the \"Street Fighting Fontainian\" music shop. Its vivid colors and dynamic lines evoke the spirit of a rock performance.\\nIt is said that practicing with the guitar beneath this sign before a show bestows a blessing from the \"Melody of the Fighter\": rock-solid rhythm, powerful bass, infectious groove, electrifying solos, and choruses that audiences chant long after the show ends.",
