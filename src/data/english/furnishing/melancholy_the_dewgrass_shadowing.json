  "description": "A luminescent grass that grows all over Mt. Yougou. When the world leaves the twilight behind, the dewdrop glows are extinguished, as if a formless shadow has passed through the grass.\\nWhen the night is in full swing, and your mind is filled with thoughts of one you miss but may not meet... Surely you, too, would feel some sadness.",
