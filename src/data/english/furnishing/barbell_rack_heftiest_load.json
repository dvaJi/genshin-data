  "name": "Barbell Rack: Heftiest Load",
  "description": "A barbell rack commonly found in the Collective of Plenty, its primary structure is forged from robust stone reinforced with metal components, ensuring exceptional load-bearing capacity. While the two designated barbell placements may appear identical, standard practice dictates placing the heavier weights on the lower tier to improve stability and prevent the user from falling over.\\nSome of the Collective of Plenty's trainers emphasize this principle when instructing newcomers in strength training â€” advising them to maintain stability at all times, grounding their core as firmly as the barbell rack itself. Only through such steadfast discipline can one advance along the path of strength.",
