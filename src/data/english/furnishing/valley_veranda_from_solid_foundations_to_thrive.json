  "description": "A perfectly straight and sturdy Liyue-style wooden passageway with an arch that connects buildings while protecting pedestrians from wind and rain. The traditions of Chenyu Vale require that apprentice artisans create a precise wooden model of a passageway with no mistake or error to prove themselves before they may begin their studies. This is because though walkways may appear ordinary at first glance, their designs involve all types of basic wooden frames, and only those with a firm foundation in the fundamentals have a chance at creating truly extraordinary architecture.",
