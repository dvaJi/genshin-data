  "description": "A Sub-Space Boulder that has the ability to ascend and descend. Its core is made of Plaustrite unique to Liyue which, after some cutting and polishing, has been made into an elegant lifting platform. Just step right on and it will rise, allowing you easy access to any other floating platforms. A certain time after you step off it, it will begin to descend again.\\nThey say that the name of this platform was quite incidentally bestowed by Moon Cover, and that it symbolizes the rising of both your fame and fortunes. That said, as an adeptus, what need does Moon Carver have of some minuscule amount of luck? Still, you and Paimon will take every last iota and ounce of luck you can get.",
