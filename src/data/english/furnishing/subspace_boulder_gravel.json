  "description": "After hearing about your experiences in the desert, Tubby designed this rock decoration based on her own imagination and Paimon's description. It resembles the actual landscape of the desert and can be used to form the basic terrain of adepti abodes.\\nThe craggy, bizarrely-shaped rock seems to be the work of the swirling storms that carry coarse sand grains with them.\\nThe irregular shape of such rocks is a sign of danger. Mercenaries walking in the desert all know that it indicates that the winds change direction frequently in the area. As a result, the sand carried here by said winds will make for treacherous footing — one step wrong, and you might sink into this quicksand.",
