  "description": "A large-sized Inazuman tea table that is mainly made of hard Aralia Wood. The inner board of stone material brings a distinctive beauty, and also has the function of stabilizing the structure. No matter how many heavy objects are placed on this tea table, it will not shake. It is a pity that the weight due to the stone structure is a significant drawback, making this tea table difficult to move and inconvenient to clean.",
