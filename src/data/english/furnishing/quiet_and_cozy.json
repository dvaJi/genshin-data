  "description": "A long, plush couch that can be found at Nasha Town's Curatorium of Secrets. Its warm palette — resembling the color of toast — gives it an irresistibly cozy and inviting appearance.\\nThe couch is habitually adorned with cat paw–patterned pillows that offer comfort to those seeking rest. Of course, certain animals will clamber up themselves, quietly joining whoever happens to be resting on it in a shared moment of warmth and tranquility.",
