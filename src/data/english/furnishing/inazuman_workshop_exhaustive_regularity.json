  "name": "Inazuman Workshop: Exhaustive Regularity",
  "description": "A broad Inazuman workshop that has combined a storage area for high-quality ore, a storehouse for semi-complete metalwork, the smith's residence, a forging station, and a weapon shop into one. In a pinch, three people can work here day and night, ensuring that the work never stops throughout the years. When one speaks of \"regularity\" in forging, one refers to practicing hard and giving one's all. To this end, it is critical to seize every moment, and it is in this fashion that the Amenoma Art became the most famous forging art in Inazuma.",
