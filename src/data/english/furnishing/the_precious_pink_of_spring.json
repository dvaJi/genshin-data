  "description": "A lush and lovely sakura that blooms at spring's beginning in classic \"ikkonzome\" pink. Legend has it that these sakura were once used as a very precious dye that required the collected essence of a hundred sakura trees just to make one kimono. Such an article of clothing was once worth more than precious gems.\\nFortunately, Her Excellency, the Almighty Ogosho, thought little of what mortals might consider \"high-class,\" and set forth a decree ordering sakura trees be protected from being used as dye-making material. Such was for the best: a lovely sight for all to behold is far more practical than a bit more opulence adorning some high-official's body, after all.",
