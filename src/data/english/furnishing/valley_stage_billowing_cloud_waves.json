  "name": "Valley Stage: Billowing Cloud Waves",
  "description": "A gorgeous, dignified single-level stage with a similar structure to the stage found in Yilong Wharf's Jiulue Teahouse. The roof is akin to a surging sea of billowing clouds, thus earning it the honorific \"Billowing Cloud Waves.\" The frame, floorboards, steps, and even the carved wooden screens are all made from Sandbearer Wood. The craftsmanship is exquisite, and the product stable and durable.\\nEvery evening, a substantial audience gathers to listen to storytellers and watch operas and plays.\\nHowever, there is a saying: \"Ancient past to recent present, what things have not come to pass? Conduct yourself with humility.\" Though the stories in operas are amazing, one cannot blindly believe them. When acting, hold fast to your principles and keep your feet firmly planted on the ground.",
