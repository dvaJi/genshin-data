  "description": "This is a unique piece of furniture formed from a chair of Adhigama Wood and massive leaves. The back of the leaves are thick and tough, which provides terrific comfort regardless of the season. The chair itself also provides support for the waists of sedentary people. When craftsmen make these chairs, they also infuse special fragrances into the leaves, granting a dichotomous effect for their touch and smell.",
