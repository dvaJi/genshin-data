  "description": "A flower pot made from simple pieces of Karmaphala Wood, filled with unique-looking plants. The appearance of the leaves in full bloom is indicative of the joy of life. But these plants didn't start out that way. After surveying the ecology of the rainforest, the Forest Rangers occasionally find areas that have not been sufficiently nourished, so they transfer the fragile plants into the pots, and once they're past their critical growth period, the Rangers will choose the right place to return them to the wild. Blooming leaves are also seen by Forest Rangers as a response to good deeds.",
