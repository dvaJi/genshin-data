  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Molten Laval Pool.\\nA nimble, fish-like mechanical construct reminiscent of the technology in ancient ruins. It can move in various liquid environments, including liquid Phlogiston — perhaps it was designed to detect and automatically approach heat sources. \\nDue to this \"heat-seeking\" trait, skilled fishers can use heat-emitting bait to lure and capture them. When disassembled, they yield remarkable components from ancient civilizations, making these \"mechanical fish\" highly valuable...\\nIn the peaceful sanctum that is the Realm Within, they are no longer required to track suspicious heat signatures and need only maintain normal operations — a sort of retirement, one might say.",
