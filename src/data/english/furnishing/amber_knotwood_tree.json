  "description": "Save for a few rare and precious tree types, the people of Liyue are accustomed to using broad-reaching collective terms for trees and aren't so fussy about the exact species of tree included. For example, trees with curved trunks are referred to by the more sophisticated-sounding term \"Knotwood.\"\\nSome artistically inclined scholars like to make a dye from the leaves of the Amber Knotwood Tree, which they add to their ink and proceed to paint and write poetry. In the eyes of another group of artistically inclined scholars, however, this is nothing more than a cheap party trick.",
