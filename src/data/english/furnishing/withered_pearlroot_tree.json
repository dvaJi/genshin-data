  "name": "Withered Pearlroot Tree",
  "description": "Save for certain trees with special nobility, the people of Liyue are more used to naming vegetation based on their morphology as opposed to their precise species. Thus, it was to these trees with pale branches that they gave the name \"Pearlroot.\"\\nThe leaves on this tree are close to withering as its internal moisture is all but gone, but it can still be used for fuel and maintains some utility as an aromatic wood.",
