  "description": "Liyue children like to play games on this stone, such as jumping to and fro between the smaller stones that surround the big one in the center. These games can be scary for a small child, but there's no risk of injury to anyone.\\nSome also say that they have seen a herb gatherer girl doing stretches while leaning against this rock in the middle of the night.",
