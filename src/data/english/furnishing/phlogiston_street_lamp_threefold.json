  "name": "Phlogiston Street Lamp: Threefold",
  "description": "A set of three phlogiston lamps, each with a stone base and a metal lamp frame, durable and reliable, found within the Masters of the Night-Wind community.\\nThe tribe is perched on the cliffs of Tezcatepetonco Range, where the rugged terrain and complex cave structures make the use and maintenance of large street lamps challenging. As a solution, people opted for a combination of smaller lamps grouped together. This not only reduced costs but also created a calm, glowing effect in the caves, akin to the serene light of Glowing Hornshrooms, ideal for meditation and deep contemplation.",
