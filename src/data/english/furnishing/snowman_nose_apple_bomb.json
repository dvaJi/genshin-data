  "description": "A snowman nose made of a failed attempt at apple pie. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nThese failed apple pies have exceedingly high internal pressure. The puff pastry has been dyed completely red by the filling and can explode at any given moment. The process of installing this nose is itself a way in which children utilize this dangerous failed product. If some child were to be unlucky enough to have the apple pie explode as it is being installed, the other children will pay for snacks to help dispel their ill-fortune.",
