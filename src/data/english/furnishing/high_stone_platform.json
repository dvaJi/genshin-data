  "description": "After Paimon and Tubby had a talk about Merusea Village, the latter combined the former's descriptions with her own imagination to create this stone covered in strange plants.\\nWhile this stone is quite tall, it is divided into two sections, with the first being a large stone commonly seen in Merusea Village, while the other is an egg-shaped rock responsible for supporting the overall weight.\\nMelusines may be small and ill-suited to climbing, but with the aid of simple tools such as stairs, they should be able to get up and down giant stones like these without issue!",
