  "description": "This type of glazed pottery is large in size, elegant in shape, and painted with gorgeous cerulean patterns, the making of which has utilized the most cutting-edge firing and coloring techniques available today. It is thus often considered a top-notch masterpiece of Sumeru pottery. It has been exported to other nations and has found a warm welcome as a worthy collectible with customers such as wealthy Fontaine merchants.\\nIt was also included in a large amount of pottery gifted to Zubayr Theater by a huge fan, which was later returned by the theater. The dancers also tend to gaze at these works for the longest period of time when they stop by the shop. The connections between varied art forms often hide in the details of daily life. Dancers can find inspiration from the many colors and shapes in nature, and imbue their dance moves with moving details. Perhaps the patterns and the curves of this pottery will be brought onto the stage someday in an awesome dynamic form through those dancers' performances.",
