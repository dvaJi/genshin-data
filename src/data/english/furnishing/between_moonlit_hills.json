  "description": "A magnificent and elegantly designed Mingxiao Lantern that is said to commemorate a certain adeptus. It is shaped like a swan goose with its wings stretched out, soaring between the cloudless moonlit sky and mountain fog. When the lights are turned on after nightfall, all who pass by the lantern would be enveloped in its warm colors and feel at peace, as if they have received some form of blessing. Gaze at it for a while longer, and you might even hear echoes of melody upon your ears.",
