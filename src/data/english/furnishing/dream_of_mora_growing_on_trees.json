  "description": "A strange plant growing in the Veluriyam Mirage, it looks like a shrub with Mora sprouting from the ground. In the eyes of visitors from Liyue, this plant can bring good fortune, and is extremely auspicious. Thus, many guests ask if they can purchase seeds of the plant, and offer exorbitant sums to have a chance to bring it to the outside world. Unfortunately, as the Veluriyam Mirage operates on special principles, these plants cannot grow elsewhere without the help of the adeptal power from The Realm Within.",
