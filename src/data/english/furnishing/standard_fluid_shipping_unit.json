  "description": "A vessel for holding liquids made from Mallow Wood that can be found in Fontainian harbors. This well-sealed container was originally specially designed by the Fontaine Research Institute for long-distance waterborne transport, and it has become ever more widely used to transport fluids as the technology has matured.\\nThey say that the designers increased its structural strength and made it easy to mass produce on account of it combining the advantages of wine barrels and wooden boxes. Although workers at the wharf often complain that these containers aren't very \"convenient,\" ship crews greatly prefer them over wine barrels that sometimes roll around the deck.",
