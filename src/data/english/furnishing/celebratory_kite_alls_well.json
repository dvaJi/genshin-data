  "description": "A kite with a Whopperflower pattern made of bamboo, paper, and other such materials that can be seen at kite stalls during the Lantern Rite festival. They say that in Liyue, the bizarre Whopperflower is not merely a symbol of cunning and treachery, but is also imbued with connotations of intelligence, alertness, and the ability to foresee danger. Those engaged in more dangerous professions may carry Whopperflower talismans in the hope of detecting danger as soon as possible to avoid disaster. For those who wish for all to be well and for being safe and sound, without mishap, flying such a kite may be a good choice.",
