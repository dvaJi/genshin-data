  "description": "A cardboard figure modeled after the gentle and shy Alpaca, so lifelike that when placed among a herd of the real, sedentary creatures, it could almost pass for one of them.\\n\"Fluffy Alpaca Sheriff\" is known for its amiable temperament, as soft as its fleece â€” towards most humans, that is. Should you happen to be a villain, however, beware: its flying kick is not to be taken lightly!",
