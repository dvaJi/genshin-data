  "description": "A floor lamp with a significant area of illumination, featuring a hybrid base made of metal on the inside and wood on the outside, balancing strength with reduced weight, commonly seen throughout the Flower-Feather Clan.\\nIn addition to its basic function as a supplemental light source, this floor lamp was specifically designed with emphasis on its brightness and illumination range. This allows people flying in the sky to spot the lamp's light even in the dark or during bad weather, helping them find their way back safely, guided by its glow.",
