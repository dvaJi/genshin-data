  "description": "A potted plant with a spacious container and a hardy, vibrant green plant as its main feature, found within the Flower-Feather Clan. It is said that due to the society's location atop the towering branches of Quahuacan Cliff, the area is frequently swept by strong mountain winds. Only plants with well-developed and stable root systems can thrive in such an environment. For this reason, the people of the Flower-Feather Clan select larger pots to allow for ample root growth. This practice is also used by flying instructors as a metaphor, reminding students to build a strong foundation in their training, for only with solid roots can one soar through storms.",
