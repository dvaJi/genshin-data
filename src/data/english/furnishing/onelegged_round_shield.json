  "description": "A sturdy, durable round stone table that can be found within the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. It is as hard as a round shield, to the point that even a club swung by some drunk patron would not even put a dent in it.\\nIt is said that because they have a very similar shape to sites of competition, the round tables of the Weary Inn are at times seen as \"battlefields\" in some sense. As such, other than \"Round Shields,\" they are also known as \"Blazing Belly Battle Tables.\"",
