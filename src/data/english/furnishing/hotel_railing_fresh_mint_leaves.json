  "name": "Hotel Railing: \"Fresh Mint Leaves\"",
  "description": "The standard railings used in the Hotel Debord. Made of sturdy materials and decorated with magnificent patterns, the air of artistry positively radiates from it. It is said that the philosophy of the Hotel Debord's owner, Vaneigem, is \"Art is the best seasoning for haute cuisine.\" In service to this philosophy, he specially ordered a set of custom ornamentation to create an elegant atmosphere of high culture, turning the entire venue into a celebration of art. And these exquisitely designed railings elevate the allure and deepness of the entire aesthetic feast, just like \"Sprinkling a few fresh mint leaves when plating.\"",
