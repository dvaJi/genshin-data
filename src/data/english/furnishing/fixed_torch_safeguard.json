  "name": "Fixed Torch: Safeguard",
  "description": "A fixed torch with a unique design and complex structure commonly found throughout the Collective of Plenty, crafted with a robust metal framework. It serves as a beacon, illuminating paths and guiding the way. The torch's distinctive design, resembling a saurian horn, is said to be inspired by the warriors who safeguard the tribe — the twin-legged metal post symbolizes the bipedal tribal warriors, while the steadfast stone horns represent the Tatankasaurs that fight by their side. The torch's flames are akin to their unyielding fighting spirit, never to be extinguished.",
