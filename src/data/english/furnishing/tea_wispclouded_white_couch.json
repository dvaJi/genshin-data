  "description": "A well-made tea set. At first glance, one is struck by the sparsity and limited variety of utensils included, but they are nevertheless sufficient to make all common tea-related beverages.\\nIt is said that this style of tea set can be traced back to a master of tea ceremonies who lived in Hanamizaka over 100 years ago. Knowing that the residents subsisted on a limited income and could not afford lavish tea sets, he put his life's knowledge to work simplifying every kind of tea set he knew and combined the strengths of each to create a kind of tea set that was complete and comprehensive but also value for money. It has grown in popularity ever since, to the point where it is even admired by the wealthy.",
