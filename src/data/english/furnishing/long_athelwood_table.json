  "description": "A long, heavy square table, made by smoked and fired Athel Wood. The surface of the table is smooth and tough. One only needs to tilt the table slightly to pour off debris. It will not accumulate dust in a dusty environment, and is thus widely used by desert dwellers.\\nLegend has it that in times past, sellswords of the Eremites would also try to bring this kind of table to set a more ceremonial tone when holding important celebrations or meetings. However, a group of Treasure Hoarders once set up crossbowmen at the negotiation site in an attempt to hurt and kidnap an important member of the Eremites for ransom. Fortunately, a sellsword with long black and gold hair was also at the scene. Seeing through the trap, she kicked down the long table and used it as protection. The Treasure Hoarders had spent all their arrows, but they failed to penetrate the table, and the Eremite member was barely scratched. In the end, the Treasure Hoarders all retreated in surprise. Since then, people have been more confident that the long table can withstand arrows.",
