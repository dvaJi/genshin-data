  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.\\nA dazzling fish with a translucent, crystal-like head, often seen gliding through the waters of Nod-Krai. Its dusky hue calls to mind a starless sky, earning it the poetic name \"Nightgaze.\"\\nResearchers have found that its head is filled with a protective fluid, housing its actual eyes, which can rotate freely to scan its surroundings with ease. This unique adaptation grants it superior vision in the dark ocean depths or under the cover of night, allowing it to navigate and react swiftly to threats, even when light is scarce.",
