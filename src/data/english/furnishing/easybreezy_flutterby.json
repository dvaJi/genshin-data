  "description": "A double-story structure within \"Easybreeze Holiday Resort,\" this building is adorned with distinct Natlan aesthetics. Its rooftop features a wooden axle shaped like the sun, from which a large windsock dangles.\\nWhile it certainly serves a decorative purpose, it is also believed that the gentle fluttering of the windsock imparts a psychological sense of coolness, ease, and delight. For this reason, it is left aloft year-round, offering a silent wish: may every visitor's summer be graced with serenity and joy.",
