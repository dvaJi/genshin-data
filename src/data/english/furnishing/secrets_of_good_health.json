  "description": "A man-made nest crafted from durable Flammabomb Wood, with a lining of soft feathers and hay, providing a cozy haven for Saurians and other large creatures. These nests are a common sight across Natlan, where hay is generally favored over fabric as a nesting material. Some speculate that this choice reflects the dual role of Saurians as both companions and warriors, suggesting that warriors should always stay vigilant and never grow complacent in excessive comfort. However, the choice of hay is ultimately for the Saurians' own well-being â€” it is easier to replace and clean, minimizing the risk of illness and disease.",
