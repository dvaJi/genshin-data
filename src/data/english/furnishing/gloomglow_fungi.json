  "description": "A plant found in certain Natlan caves, notable for its highly unusual shape and faint luminescence. From a distance, it resembles a cluster of oversized mushrooms, earning it the name \"Gloomglow Fungi.\" They say that medicines derived from this plant can be used to treat various ailments, though if handled improperly, its medicinal properties may be lost. For this reason, when it comes to harvesting, the assistance of a pharmacist from the Masters of the Night-Wind is usually required.",
