  "description": "The stone walls of a lofty tower, embellished with reliefs and adorned with stepped, asymmetrical patterns that create a sense of dynamic motion. They work equally well as both internal partitions and protective outer walls.\\nIt is said that the three metallic ornaments and asymmetric patterns on these walls \"disrupt\" a composition, creating a sense of imbalance and making the surface difficult to work with. As a result, this type of Natlan-style wall is relatively seldom used. Yet despite this, some master artists will go out of their way to procure such walls, believing that the more imbalanced and challenging the canvas itself, the better their graffiti will reflect the adventurous spirit of Natlan.",
