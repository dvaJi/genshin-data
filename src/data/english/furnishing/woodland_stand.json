  "description": "A stand exquisitely handcrafted by the craftsmen at Acara Crafts based on the depiction of the Aranara's homeland in fairy tales, with enough space to accommodate 6 \"Aranara Carvings.\"\\nAt first, only one such stand was crafted as a showcase. However, on account of the popularity of the woodcarvings and the eager requests of children, it soon went into mass production as well.\\nIt is said that its selling price is lower than the production cost. Yet this is no pricing mistake, but rather a sales strategy.",
