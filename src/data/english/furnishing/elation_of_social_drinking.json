  "description": "This round stool is the result of adjusting the dimensions and streamlining the production process of the typical Ash Wood bench. Often found near bars or around rectangular tables in establishments like hotels and cafés within the Court of Fontaine, this lightweight and portable stool is favored by guests engaged in social gatherings. While it may lack the comfort of chairs with backrests, the joy of companionship tends to outweigh such inconveniences.",
