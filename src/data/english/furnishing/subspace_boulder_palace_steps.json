  "description": "One of the rocks that form part of the basic terrain of adepti abodes. This one is rectangular and smooth.\\nIt is said that Mountain Shaper is quite fond of using such rocks to build steps. The number of people who come to seek the adeptus is as an endless stream, and yet none have been able to find this one's footsteps — they certainly did find a wealth of messy heron claw markings, however.",
