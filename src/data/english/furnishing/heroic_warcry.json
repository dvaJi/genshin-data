  "description": "A conical drum, tuned with ropes, the same shape as those commonly found in the People of the Springs. It is said that due to its masterful design, this type of drum can produce a sound both deep and piercing. When many are struck in tandem, their soul-moving rhythm is like that of a war cry. As such, Natlanese musicians often play on these drums before battle to boost the morale of their troops and fill their hearts with courage.",
