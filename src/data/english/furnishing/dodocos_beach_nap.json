  "description": "\"A reclining chair is a reclining chair, not a trampoline. You should really just lie on it and bask in the sun.\"\\n\"C'mon, this chair is pretty tough. Klee can jump on it, and it'll be just fine!\"\\n\"Naturally. Ms. Alice did design it, after all. I suspect that even a Ruin Guard might not be able to break it.\"\\n\"If we tie three of these chairs together, we might be able to make a giant slingshot and send Jumpy Dumpties over the city walls and into Cider Lake!\"\\n...\\nThe Acting Grand Master happened to overhear this chat between Klee and Albedo as she passed by.\\nAs such, Albedo had to write a guarantee that \"mementos from the Golden Apple Archipelago will not be modified for use in pranks\" on Klee's behalf after these reclining chairs were brought back to Mondstadt.",
