  "description": "This leaf sample is capable of emitting a soft light. At first glance, it might seem like a decorative object to be placed on a desk, but in actuality, this leaf sample is also a key tool used to observe the ecological condition of the rainforest. By soaking the plant's leaves in fluorescent material and supplementing it with special reagents when investigating an area, the harmful substances festering in the veins of the leaf will have nowhere to hide, thus assisting in the analysis of soil pollution. Should the leaf be shining as bright as it does on the desk, then it means the growing environment must be akin to the purest water.",
