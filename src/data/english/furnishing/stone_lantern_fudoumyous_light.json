  "description": "These majestic and exquisitely crafted stone lanterns are exceedingly heavy and have a stable foundation.\\nIt is said that this kind of lantern can not only light the road ahead but can also help to withstand natural disasters such as storms if ropes are tied between them and the house.\\nHowever, Inazuma's weather is controlled by the Raiden Shogun, and so the people hold that they have \"nothing to fear even should the neighboring Anemo Archon bring forth a storm, for it shall be cut down in a single blow by the Shogun.\" Thus, the additional function of these lanterns has never been tested.",
