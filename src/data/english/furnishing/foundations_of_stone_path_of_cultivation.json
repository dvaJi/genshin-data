  "description": "A pavement created using dense stones. The slabs are arranged in a regular fashion and are often used to pave exposed ground in towns and cities.\\nThe clean, hard stones utilize a traditional art from Liyue that melts and melds smashed stone and sand grains together to form slabs that are sturdy, long-lasting, and inexpensive, thus making them much sought after across the continent.\\nStonemasons have an ancient saying amongst themselves: \"To work with stone is to cultivate oneself.\" The act of carefully grinding each stone slab is also an act of sharpening one's own character â€” this is the norm for a proper stonemason. As people tread upon these stone pavements, they too become beneficiaries of this particular saying.",
