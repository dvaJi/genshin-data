  "description": "A special toy decoration that evokes the rainforest. It resembles a giant mushroom with a small swing hanging from its cap for little Fungi dolls to play on. Its inside is lined with lights and moving metal parts, allowing the Fungi dolls to rotate in place, bathed in a gentle glow... Like a forest whispering in your ear, blessing you with peaceful dreams.",
