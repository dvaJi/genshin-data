  "description": "A relatively short ground light, round in form and softly contoured, featuring a canopy of Natlan-inspired design atop a circular wooden base. Frequently placed along pathways, it rests by day like a polished gem upon the earth. Come nightfall, it transforms into a gentle star of the land, casting a warm glow to illuminate the way for wandering guests.",
