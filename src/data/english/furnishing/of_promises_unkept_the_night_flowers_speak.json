  "description": "Fluorescent flowers that can commonly be found in Chinju Forest. Under the moonlight, these sky-blue blooms flow in silence, as if in agonized waiting for one who left all too suddenly.\\n\"Promises\" are a powerful force, so powerful that they can slow the senses, even until the passage of time itself might be dulled. Mortals ensnared by such forces may be suddenly surprised to find, while looking in a mirror, that they have suddenly sprouted white hair, but for certain beings that shall never grow old, perhaps such endless waiting is an incalculable sorrow.",
