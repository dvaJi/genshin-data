  "description": "A large signboard made of Fragrant Cedar Wood featuring ceramic tile rain eaves emblematic of the Chenyu Vale style of architecture. Simple yet elegant, they are also extremely strong and durable and can be found in Yilong Wharf.\\nAs Yilong Wharf's climate is relatively humid, conventional paper notices posted would easily be washed away by rain or damaged by moisture, making their text difficult to discern. Thus, the carpenters customized the rain eaves for this announcement board, making it rainproof while maintaining its aestheticsâ€” a classic case of object modification.",
