  "description": "A lush tree that seems to glow like tea leaves in the bright daylight. Every year when midsummer comes along, these trees will give off a light and sweet fragrance. In truth, the plants of this tree cannot really be eaten, much less brewed into tea. To prevent children from being attracted to this aroma and chowing down on this plant's leaves, several parents invented the story of \"Specters and Strong Tea,\" claiming that Specters eat these leaves. Upon hearing this, the children have learned to keep their distance.",
