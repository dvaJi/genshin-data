  "description": "The corridor of a Refined Estate. Simply made, it is also intended to block the wind and rain.\\nPerhaps this is due to their adopting low sitting stances for long periods of time when indoors, but when Inazumans go out on strolls, they do not do so in fits and starts, instead aiming to fully stretch out their limbs, only sitting down for brief chats with old friends. As such, these walkways have never been designed with seats for resting.",
