  "name": "Paddock Fence: Simple Boundary",
  "description": "A simple, low-cost fence constructed from Flammabomb Wood planks, rope, and a supporting frame, adorned with colorful paintings in a Natlan style. Apparently, its height is such that neither people nor saurians would be hindered from climbing over. This, they say, is the result of years of refinement â€” low enough for humans to easily keep an eye on the saurians from the outside, while also high enough to give the saurians a sense of security so that they can live at ease.",
