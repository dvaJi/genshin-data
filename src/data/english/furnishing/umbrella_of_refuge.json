  "description": "A plant that grows in the silent rainforest. Its round, umbrella-shaped leaves and its vivid green coloration really reflect its vitality.\\nIts leaves are relatively thicker compared to other plants of its kind. The leaves rarely sway from side to side even during a downpour, making it a perfect shelter for small animals to hide in.",
