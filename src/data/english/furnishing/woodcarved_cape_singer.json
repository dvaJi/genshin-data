  "description": "A wood-carved cape colored almost identical to the stunning sunset glow that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the cape of a well-known opera artist in Liyue Harbor. One noticeable feature of Sumeru fairy tales — indeed, of Sumeru tales in general — is the combination of storytelling with singing. Therefore, storytellers from Sumeru are often talented singers. There are many singing Aranara in these stories, too. Some are soloists, while others form choruses, and their songs are ever so delicately interwoven with melodies that have been passed down since ancient times.",
