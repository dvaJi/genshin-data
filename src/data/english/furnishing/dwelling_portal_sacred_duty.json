  "description": "The grand entrance of a lofty tower that features solid stone doorposts adorned with intricately crafted golden reliefs, evoking the grandeur of the gateway to a sacred temple.\\nIn ancient Natlan, crossing such a threshold symbolized one of two things — either departing to do battle against the Abyss, or marching back in triumphant return. Given the solemn reverence called for by both such moments, these entryways were elaborately decorated to pay homage to the warriors' valor. This tradition endures even to this day, and as a result, the entrances to Natlan-style courtyards are still renowned for their dignified and sacred aura.",
