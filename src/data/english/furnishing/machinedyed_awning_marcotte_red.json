  "description": "A bulk-manufactured awning in Marcotte Red produced with the assistance of clockwork meka.\\nIt is both a common good and a testament to Fontaine's technological prowess. Originally, the researchers' goal was to use fully automate the manufacturing process, using clockwork meka to create identically sized products and lowering production costs. The automated manufacturing process for the awnings already successful, with no human labor involved in weaving, post-processing and dyeing. However, in order to assemble tiny parts, current meka designs must be improved to give them a high degree of precision, which demands huge investments that exceed the cost reductions achieved. Because of this, the project researchers did not obsessively pursue full automation.",
