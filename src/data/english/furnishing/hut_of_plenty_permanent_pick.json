  "description": "A gorgeous hut widely seen throughout the Collective of Plenty, constructed with a robust Flammabomb Wood framework, offering protection from the rain and sun. It is said that the load-bearing structures within these huts are no different from those of wooden houses, with a complete set of beams and other components. The only notable distinction is that their walls are made of fabric rather than wood. As a result, these huts are remarkably stable, yet require less maintenance than wooden structures, making them ideal for semi-permanent uses such as temporary tents for tending fields or long-term tribal storefronts.",
