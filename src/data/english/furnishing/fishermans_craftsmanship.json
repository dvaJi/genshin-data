  "description": "A simple rack crafted from Adhigama Wood and Brightwood. Different animal hides were sewn together before being stretched out on this tool to be dried together. This method allows hunters to make use of small hides effectively.\\nHowever, some say that this is not what the tool was originally designed for — one used to hang fishing nets on the rack to clear the fish they had caught of sand and mud.\\nToday, no one cares about its original purpose. The locals have a simple philosophy: Anything can be used anyway, it's all a matter of convenience!",
