  "description": "A relatively common type of rock in the mountains of Natlan. Though seemingly small and scattered, they are usually the sharp tips of larger boulders that would be difficult for humans to move. It is said that when crossing the mountains, experienced couriers typically steer clear of routes with many such rocks, as their imperceptible sharp edges could pose a hidden danger when moving at high speeds.",
