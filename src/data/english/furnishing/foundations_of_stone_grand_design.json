  "description": "A pavement created using dense stones. These stones are arranged in a rather unique way indeed.\\nThe clean, hard stones utilize a traditional art from Liyue that melts and melds smashed stone and sand grains together to form slabs that are sturdy, long-lasting, and inexpensive, thus making them much sought after across the continent.\\nIt is said that floorings of this kind give equal weight to aesthetics and load-bearing capacity, and may serve as the foundation for great structures indeed. Some festivals and performances are also held in squares paved with such stone tiles.",
