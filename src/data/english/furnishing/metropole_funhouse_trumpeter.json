  "description": "A tall two-story building extremely common in Constellation Metropole, with an appearance that seems to share some similarities with those of Fontaine, though the methods employed are substantially different. The most distinctive characteristic of these buildings is the massive \"clockwork keys\" on the outer walls. This unique design feature allows the buildings to provide massive amounts of kinetic energy even with limited space, allowing them to drive complex systems of gears and tracks. This has made them an ideal choice for both expanding the available vertical space while providing auxiliary energy.\\nLegend holds that a resident of Constellation Metropole once discovered by chance that if you look at the building from a certain angle, the profile of the building looks like a musician playing a trumpet. For this reason, they bestowed the moniker \"the Trumpeter\" on this building, and thenceforth, this imaginative name spread throughout some of the citizenry of Constellation Metropole.",
