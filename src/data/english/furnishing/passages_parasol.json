  "description": "A parasol that features a metal load-bearing structure and incorporates numerous parts produced with the aid of clockwork meka. Originally ordered by Caf√© Lutece, these parasols became one of the signature furnishings of the Vasari Passage as its business boomed.\\nFollowing an incident involving significant color discrepancies, merchants started hiring specialists to oversee the meka-assisted dyeing process, ensuring strict quality control. The colors of the parasols are designed to evoke the feeling of \"a balmy day and clear skies,\" aiming to create a pleasant atmosphere for patrons sipping coffee beneath them, regardless of the actual weather.",
