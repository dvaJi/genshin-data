  "description": "A parasol that features a metal load-bearing structure and incorporates numerous parts produced with the aid of clockwork meka. Originally ordered by Café Lucerne, these parasols became one of the signature furnishings of the Vasari Passage as its business boomed.\\nFollowing an incident involving significant color discrepancies, merchants started hiring specialists to oversee the meka-assisted dyeing process, ensuring strict quality control. The colors of the parasols are designed to evoke the feeling of \"a balmy day and clear skies,\" aiming to create a pleasant atmosphere for patrons sipping coffee beneath them, regardless of the actual weather.",
