  "description": "A finely crafted stone model, said to have been carved in imitation of a mysterious pillar within the Core of Chu'ulel. A luminous tetrahedron floats at its center, a creation of Tubby's adeptal power. While it lacks the original's miraculous ability to purge Abyssal defilement, it radiates a heartwarming glow nevertheless.\\nJust as the Abyss's filth is but a transient blight, so too will the pillar's light shine forth once more. Do not let temporary setbacks defeat you, for such is the path that every adventurer must tread.",
