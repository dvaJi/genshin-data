  "description": "A large pond for rearing fish.\\nThis pond is common in garden landscapes in the outside world, but it has been imbued with some mysterious properties inside The Realm Within by the arts of Sub-Space Creation. Its waters are clear and warm all year round, contains a subtle balance of nutrients, and the ornamental fish within grow slowly but maintain their original vitality without the need for the owner to take too much care of it. However, it would be unwise to raise too many ornamental fish in one pond if you wish for them to have enough room.\\nOrnamental Fish caught via Fishing can be raised in this sort of pond.",
