  "description": "A slowly spinning model of furious flowers that can be placed on a \"Good Shelf\" for display. According to the legends, furious flowers will curl up when they sleep, and when rudely awakened by sudden impacts, they will make their immense displeasure known by unleashing their floral fury. Only flying squirrels of surpassing skill can soar on the powerful currents produced. For this reason, challenging the floral fury of the furious flowers has become a way for flying squirrels to prove their ability. As such, these flowers have been given a cute nickname: that of \"Flying Instructors.\"",
