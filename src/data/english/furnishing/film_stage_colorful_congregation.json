  "description": "The main stage of the Chevalmarin Film Fantasyland, outfitted with wavelike patterns and ribbons to host nothing but the grandest of performances.\\nAstute film connoisseurs may notice that this decor is reminiscent of Surintendante Chevalmarin, the park's super-cute mascot, as well as a certain famous superstar. Love for films, admiration and appreciation for the talents of superstars, and support for lovely mascots all come together to form the \"colorful congregation\" that cheers them on.",
