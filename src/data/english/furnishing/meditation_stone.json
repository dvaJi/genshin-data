  "description": "According to a legend circulating in Hanamizaka, these flat stones are very rare indeed, and only several can be found, few and far between, beside waterfalls, where they are used for martial artists to meditate on their craft.\\nQuite contrary to the \"cold water ablutions\" or \"mizugori\" spoken of by the various light novels published by Yae Publishing House, some martial artists do not believe in using the waters of such waterfalls to cleanse their sins or hone their willpower. Instead, their intent is simply to use the white noise from the flowing waterfall to drown out all other ambient noises, thus allowing them to achieve a unique form of \"silence.\"\\nMedical theories from other nations have also indicated that sitting under waterfalls for too long might actually result in some strange trauma injuries.",
