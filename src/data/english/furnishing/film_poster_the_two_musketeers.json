  "description": "The vertical banner prepared by Xavier's film company specifically for the Fontinalia Film Festival, which sketches the general themes of the film \"The Two Musketeers.\" Set against the backdrop of night, the poster portrays the two main characters covering each other, bravely launching an assault upon their enemies under the moonlight.\\nAs critics have noted, the film and its underlying story may fade from people's memories over time, but the theme of \"justice\" will be etched in their hearts. This, then, may have been precisely the goal that Chevreuse, who played the protagonist, was pursuing all along.",
