  "description": "A majestic tower that recreates the glorious sights of Natlan within the Serenitea Pot, courtesy of the Scroll of the Fiery Firmament. Built entirely from solid and dependable volcanic rock, the air of solemn grandeur it exudes is reminiscent of the Stadium of the Sacred Flame itself. Though it cannot match the Stadium's imposing scale, those that climb its steps often experience a surge of vigor and determination, as though they were ascending to the heart of a martial contest in full swing. This makes it the ideal setting for any form of training, for which it yields outstanding results.",
