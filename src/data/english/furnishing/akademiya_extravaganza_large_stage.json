  "description": "The main stage of the Akademiya Extravaganza. It was built using excellent wood and decorated in the style of the Akademiya itself. Spacious, tall, beautiful, and imposing, it has a modular design and can be built quickly even by non-professional students, thus saving on work time and allowing more effort to be put into the various celebratory events, all the better to make this event.",
