  "description": "A seemingly unremarkable display stand which in fact cunningly conceals secrets. Its unassuming appearance allows it to cleverly blend into its surroundings, often escaping attention from passersby. The Palais Mermonia has supposedly taken advantage of this to use it to hold spare parts for whenever they might be needed in the future. Whenever a part is required, try looking in these display stands, and you might just be pleasantly surprised by what you find.",
