  "description": "A fish dryer with an Adhigama Wood structure and Brightwood plates on top. It is easy to manufacture and store, and is said to be a daily necessity in every fisher's family. Fish that are mildly dried strike a balance between good flavor and easy storage. Some people who have the habit of eating dried fish would have it with Sumeru Spice to add some flavor.",
