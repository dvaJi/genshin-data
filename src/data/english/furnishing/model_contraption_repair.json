  "description": "A complex metal model which is a scaled-down model of a certain Pneumousia Energy Supply Device. It is akin to its original in most ways, save for the ability to actually supply energy.\\nThey say that this model was originally used as a repair training device for technicians new to the job. However, all dismantled or otherwise messed-up training devices must be restored by a specialist once the training ends, and thus a \"training device repair specialist\" was added to the training department.\\nIn some ways, such staff members became those who were most familiar with this type of Pneumousia device. The only thing that stops them from becoming official repair staff is the incredibly hard-to-gain Pneumousia Environs Work Permit.",
