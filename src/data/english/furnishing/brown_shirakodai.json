  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace.\\nA gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant. It has a lovely, streamlined dorsal fin, and has the nickname \"Queen of the Waters.\"\\nEarthen-colored patterns run across its body, and its temper is also as steady as stone. They can go a bit overboard, however, and will sometimes lie at the bottom and not move an inch, just like a rock, leading some buyers to think that they've bought some hopelessly moribund old fish.",
