  "description": "An ornamental shrub adorned with aqua-colored flowers that can be found near the Fountain of Lucine. It is a relative of one of the street shrubs in the Court of Fontaine itself. Folklore has it that these shrubs have obtained the blessing of the fountain they grow around, which is why their flowers bloom water-blue rather than their original yellow. Those who pluck these flowers are said to incur the wrath of the fountain, doomed to such water-related instances of ill luck as always stepping on a loose floorboard on a rainy day, or being soaked by a passing Gardemek stomping in a puddle.\\nOf course, these are just a pack of lies completely unrelated to the flowers. Even the trousers of those who do not pick these flowers are at the mercy of potential attack by loose floorboards brimming with muddy water.",
