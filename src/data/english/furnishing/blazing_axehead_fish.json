  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace and Shaded Clarity.\\nA fish with unique morphology and family ties to the Axe Marlins. Some biologists have theorized that the species split when the Axe Marlins took an evolutionary gamble on axe-shaped bellies, while the Axehead Fishes doubled down on axe-shaped skulls.\\nThis rare variant, marked by a vivid, searing red spine — like a branding iron — is an uncommon sight in the waters of Nod-Krai. Local legends tell of a time when those who dared provoke nature's ire drifted on boats across these waters, only for this fish to silently appear and slice through their hulls with its blazing-hot back, sending the wrongdoers to a watery grave. Out of respect (and perhaps a touch of superstition), lucky anglers who manage to reel in a Blazing Axehead often release it back into the wild, or house it reverently in an ornate aquarium.",
