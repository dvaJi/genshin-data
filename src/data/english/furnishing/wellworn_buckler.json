  "description": "A worn wooden buckler used as decoration. It can still be taken down and used.\\nMondstadt's hunters have a tradition of displaying armor in their homes, believing that this will encourage future generations to continue in the spirit of the hunt.\\nBut their children took to throwing it around like a frisbee, hitting a wild boar in the next-door hill in the process. As a result, the hunters have locked those round bucklers in place to prevent any such dangerous games from being invented in the future.",
