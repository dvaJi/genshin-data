  "description": "A simple and rustic wooden house often found to the west of Sumeru City. It is structurally similar to the buildings in Vimara Village. Placing some leaves and hay on a Karmaphala Wood frame would yield this very cheap dwelling place. Many weavers spend years living in these houses, not due to poverty, but because they are already used to working in this kind of environment, and dislike spending time getting rid of new distractions after moving to a new place.",
