  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace.\\nA rare species of Medaka that has a brilliant sheen. It seems like a variant species of the normal Medaka, but it has a very different appearance and living habits.\\nThere is a rumor that these fish have the mystical ability to predict the weather. If they leap out of the water to catch the dawn's first light as it pierces the skies, then there will surely be a fine, sunny day to come.",
