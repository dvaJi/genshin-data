  "description": "A spacious circular arena, modeled after \"Pankration Ring\" in the Fortress of Meropide, which accurately recreates the landscape of the arena. Stepping into it, one can almost hear the audience's enthusiastic cheers.\\nThroughout history, only those who possessed both strength and strong character have been able to enjoy lasting honor and applause. The sole path to success, it seems, is the eternal commitment to \"go all in,\" full force forward.",
