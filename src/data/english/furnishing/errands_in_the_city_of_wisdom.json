  "description": "A structure of compact design that is at once economical with space and possesses terrific functions to sustain a single individual over long periods of time. Such is why the Adventurers' Guild chose it to serve as Katheryne's office.\\nFor Adventurers traveling through Sumeru City, the taverns, caf√©s, and smithies might all blur together, but the house belonging to the Adventurers' Guild will always remain familiar. This little building, after all, is where they pick up their quests and collect their rewards.",
