  "description": "The stone walls of a lofty tower, embellished with reliefs and featuring central doorways for passage. It is common for the walls of Natlan-style courtyards to be decorated with reliefs, ornaments, and graffiti, thus transforming them into a series of \"murals\" with distinct themes. Placing doorways at their center enables the viewer to traverse the boundaries between various creative realms, a wondrous experience indeed.",
