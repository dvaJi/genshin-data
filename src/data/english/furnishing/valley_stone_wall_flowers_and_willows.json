  "description": "Plain white stone walls with dark gray tiles are a common sight in Chenyu Vale. Because they are unadorned, they are often mistaken for being rough or even temporary external walls. But in reality, the courtyards of Liyue are full of hidden meanings, and their designs abhor everything being visible at a glance. There may be a completely different and fascinating world hidden behind their simplicity.",
