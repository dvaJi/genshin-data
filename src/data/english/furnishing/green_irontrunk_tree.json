  "description": "Save for a few rare and precious tree types, the people of Liyue are accustomed to using broad-reaching collective terms for trees and aren't so fussy about the exact species of tree included. For example, trees with straight trunks are referred to by the more sophisticated-sounding term \"Irontrunk.\"\\nThe Green Irontrunk Tree is a ubiquitous sight in mountainous areas. Its timber is regularly used for building houses and merchant boats.",
