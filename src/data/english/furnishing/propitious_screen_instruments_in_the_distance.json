  "description": "A folding screen delicately crafted by the most skillful artisans. Its frame is made from Sandbearer Wood with a vermillion finish, and the finest silk was selected as its fabric. Among the multitude of splendid decorations at the Lantern Rite, this folding screen can be considered a rare masterpiece. The painting on it depicts two musicians playing the flute and zither in a duet accompanied by bamboo and maple leaves. One can almost hear the stream of music coming from the screen.",
