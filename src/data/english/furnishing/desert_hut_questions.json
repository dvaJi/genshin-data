  "description": "A hut that may be found in Aaru village. It has a sand-colored roof and the shade it provides is quite ample indeed. It is said that such roofs were first built for the guards near the village entrance. One of the scholars temporarily dwelling in Aaru Village once suggested this: \"If we use vibrant colors for the guardhouse roof, people can quickly find them and thus locate those who can help them easily.\" Yellow objects are, in theory, quite striking, but in a place such as the desert, it is doomed to simply melt into the sandy backdrop...\\nFortunately, the guards do not simply stand guard in one place, and these huts would later be repurposed, never again to become a thorn in the side of those seeking help.",
