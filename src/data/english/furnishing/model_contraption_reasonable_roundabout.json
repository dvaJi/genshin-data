  "description": "A metal model that seems more complicated than it has to be. They tell you that it was made in imitation of a machine that was used to test certain types of data, capturing and combining the angle, speed, and direction in which several concentric circles rotate, from which professional researchers could derive the data they needed.\\nThis is just a model, however, and the concentric circles simply rotate on their carefree axis, each object following its natural trajectory, unburdened by any special meaning â€” or so a certain researcher said to themselves upon looking at it after a night of agonizing calculations.\\nPerhaps an ordinary person or researcher who wants to shirk work might see those stable, spinning model circles as something more admirable than inscrutable data points.",
