  "description": "A weapon rack that has Shogunate-style longbows mounted on it.\\nThe pedestrian appearance of these bows belie the excellent capabilities built into them by the master craftspeople of Narukami Island. From the more objective ratings of artisans from Fontaine, these bows have more draw and throwing weight than their resistance counterparts, and when the arrows are let loose, their force is also greater. Their speed retention is also excellent, thus making them superior in essentially every way.\\nYet even the best bowmen of the Shogun's army, wielding these bows, have been defeated time and again by the resistance army's \"pointy-eared general,\" to the point where they might take him on seven to one yet be forced back with great loss. Try as they might, the Shogun's army have never been able to figure out why this is so, and its officers were ultimately forced to petition Madame Kujou Sara to take the field against him and even the odds safely.",
