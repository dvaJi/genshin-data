  "description": "A uniquely-shaped structure made of metal and glass that shares the same model as the one in The Steambird main office. It is quite special, with a circular central structure and being divided into eight panels. The blue glass roof shimmers under the sunlight like crystal.\\nAs reporters write, the sun's light is often likened to \"truth\" and \"justice.\" It is quite possible that the newspaper chose this design to remind those entering and exiting of their commitment to being a \"credible source.\"",
