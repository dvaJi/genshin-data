  "description": "Such buildings are commonly seen in Tatarasuna. Though they may seem quite narrow and tight, they can actually seat at least 10 people at a go. The workers at the Mikage Furnace most often use such buildings as canteens, so they can get to work quickly. Once a day's work is done, those with the energy and inclination will also gather here to have a few drinks, talk about their families, and relieve some work stress.",
