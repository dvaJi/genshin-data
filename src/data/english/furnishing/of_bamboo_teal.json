  "description": "This seemingly ordinary \"bamboo-teal\" shrub grows just nicely under specific humidity. It is said that when dried in the sun, it can be used as medicine to relieve dampness and heat. However, the most notable aspect of these plants lies in their speedy growth. As long as they are not pulled up by the roots, they will always regrow into their ideal forms within a few months, much like a green flame bursting forth from the ground. As such, some less popular authors once took it as a symbol of immense vitality and wrote it into their poems and stories.",
