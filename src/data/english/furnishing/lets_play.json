  "description": "A simple swing made from Ash Wood that can be found in Merusea Village. The tales tell that the Melusine who made them had trouble enjoying swings due to the height difference between her and humans, and in order to enjoy this same simple pleasure, she constructed one with more appropriate dimensions.\\nHowever, due to Melusines not being used to making particularly sturdy ropes, few of them ever use this swing as anything but a suspended chair.",
