  "description": "A spacious Liyue-style domicile with a separate kitchen and chimney. It is said that recluses particularly like this sort of house.\\nThe seaside areas of Liyue enjoy a rather gentle climate and those who live there need no hearths with which to withstand the bitter winter. However, cooking a steaming-hot meal in a fully-furnished kitchen rather than setting some simple stove up to make one's three meals is an arguably more fitting way for your Liyue resident to live.",
