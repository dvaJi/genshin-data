  "description": "This display, which was a gift from Bennett, goes at the front of the shop, showing off a fresh, perfectly-baked loaf of bread that is the mainstay here at the shop. After being left in place for a time, it may become hard enough to crush a pinecone with a light swing, but you can still get a good mouthfeel out of it if you soak it in hot soup for a while.\\n\"Paimon sure is experienced at combining dishes together.\"\\n\"'You can get sick of even the best dishes if you have a few mouthfuls of too many of them. That's why main dishes with lighter flavors and textures designed to satisfy are both delicious and filling!'\"",
