  "description": "An ornamental shrub that stands within the garden known as \"Of Fields Green.\" It resembles a cat guard wearing a wide ceremonial uniform.\\n\"Of Fields Green\" draws inspiration from wonderlands in fairy tales. The cat guards are capable of reading the emotions of those who come to Wonderland, scattering the troubles of the children aside like so much black smog. The unique shape of these lovely shrubs also help to ease the mood of those who wander amidst the courtyard.",
