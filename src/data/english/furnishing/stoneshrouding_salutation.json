  "description": "Apart from some rare and precious trees, the people of Liyue are more used to naming trees using broad-reaching, appearance-based terms for types of trees at large, rather than naming exact species. For trees with knotted, curving trunks, they often say that it is \"as one saluting.\"\\nChenyu Vale is a rugged land with many trees rooted upon clefts in the rock. Some ancestors of Chenyu Vale believed that the roots of such trees could wrap around and encircle the rock and stone, hence the unique appellation \"Stoneshrouding.\"",
