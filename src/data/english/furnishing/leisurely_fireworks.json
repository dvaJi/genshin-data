  "description": "A delicate \"Launch Tube\" with an exquisite design. It is indeed one of the best gifts for the people of Liyue. The \"Launch Tube\" is filled with firework beads carefully pre-made by craftsmen, and can be set off with a simple operation.\\nSome Liyue people believe that \"there is no need to wait for a feast or a festival, you can set off fireworks when you feel like it, you don't have to be restricted by certain rules.\" After all, watching fireworks is a means of relaxation. It is said that the captain of the Crux Fleet would occasionally set off fireworks with a specific pattern when the fleet was at anchor to boost the morale of the crew. If necessary, this Launch Tube can also be used as a flare launcher.",
