  "description": "A large group of mauve-colored fungi. They possess a tenacious vitality and surfaces with unique properties that simultaneously grant them great springiness and the ability to retain moisture for long periods. In theory, these fungi could be used to maintain the humidity of a courtyard, but they seem to only grow in special environments and do not take well to transplantation into more mundane locales.\\nIt is said that they display the special markings of the Shiverstroke art of calligraphic penmanship if you look at them from just the right angle, which is how they got their name.",
