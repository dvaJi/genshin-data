  "description": "A curved structure that one might find in Sumeru. It appears to be a simple wall that does not seem particularly thick, but in truth, its frame relies on a mix of wood and vines that has proved much tougher than first meets the eye. Even if some bricks may come loose, the structure will not fall easily, making it rather easy to repair.",
