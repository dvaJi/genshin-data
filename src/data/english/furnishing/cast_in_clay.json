  "description": "A flower vase of exceedingly good quality, it is placed at the doorstep of the Yashiro Commission Headquarters. This vase has seen quite a few years, and indeed none of the house retainers really know where it comes from. However, a professional would be able to tell that from the unique glazing it has, it must have come from before the era of the Sakoku Decree â€” it was purchased from Liyue at a rather high price long ago. That batch of porcelain work inspired many an Inazuman artisan and helped to usher in a new age in local art. As of today, Inazuma has long established its own unique culture of porcelain work.",
