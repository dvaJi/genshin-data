  "description": "These lanterns can be found in Tenshukaku and at the Royal Hot Springs. The fabrics have not been dyed per se, but have been coated by soaking them in a solution created by dissolving trace amounts of Amethyst Lumps and Electro Crystals in water. They say that this coating is not only able to increase the brightness of such lanterns, but can also protect them from lightning.",
