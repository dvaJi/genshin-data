  "description": "A piece of art left behind by Julien, an unknown artist from Fontaine. It depicts the Vourukasha Oasis in different hues, with the bold use of color and free brushstrokes hinting at the all-new understanding of artistry that he has. Who knows? Perhaps the vast world he has never set foot in will bring him still more inspiration.",
