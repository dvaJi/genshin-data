  "name": "Tearstone Tile: Perspective Theory",
  "description": "This floor tile, engraved with special patterns, appears similar to the Tearstone tiles found throughout Fontaine.\\nAs the hardness of Tearstone makes it almost impossible to sculpt them in detail, even with the assistance of meka, most tiles are regular square shapes with patterns carved on their surface.\\nRumor has it that the painter who designed these tiles was struggling with his studies of perspective theory, and he mistakenly submitted his coursework as a design proposal. As a result, the person in charge at the time fell in love with the creativity displayed in the design, and with a few modifications, the aesthetic of the tiles we know today was born.",
