  "description": "A glamorous, two-story building with the same appearance and construction as the pavilions near the Razan Garden. The dark gold frames are thin yet firm, and separate the glass dome vertically into four quarters, while also dividing it horizontally into shades of lazurite, cerulean, and aquamarine. Be it night or day, whether the gentle sun or bright moon hangs in the sky, the light cast down from the glass dome is always dyed a splendid hue.",
