  "description": "A strange shrub growing within the Forest of Blessings. Nobody can help but think of tightly packed layers of cabbage leaves upon seeing its heavy spherical crown.\\nDue to its pleasing appearance, low price, and ease of preparation, many chefs use cabbage as a garnish as well as an ingredient, adding a vivid green touch to the finished dish. Perhaps this was the inspiration for the Goddess of Creation using these Crownospheres to bless the Forest with greenery.",
