  "description": "A fixed torch prominently featured in the Grand Wrestling Grounds of the Collective of Plenty, crafted with Flammabomb Wood and metal components. The term \"Extremity\" originates from the title of the \"Grand Wrestling Extreme Champion,\" a legendary combatant who, in a single day, triumphed over thirty consecutive challengers, marking the first recorded nighttime matches in the arena's history. The torches that were ignited to illuminate the matches that night were later renamed \"Extremity\" in honor of this formidable wrestler, and their legacy lives on to this day.",
