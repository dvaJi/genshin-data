  "name": "Phlogiston Street Lamp: The Road Ahead",
  "description": "A uniquely shaped street lamp with a natural stone base and block-shaped phlogiston as its light source, commonly seen throughout the Masters of the Night-Wind community.\\nThe tribe's architecture and facilities are known for their exaggerated lines, which are said to be inspired by the distinctive crest of the Iktomisaurs. For many, the Iktomisaur is not only a family member and companion but also a guiding signpost along their spiritual journey. Thus, artisans crafted these lamps with the light source positioned in the most eye-catching part of the Saurian's crest, ensuring the lamp serves not only as illumination but also as a beacon guiding people on the path they seek.",
