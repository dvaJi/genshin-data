  "description": "A unique statue discovered during \"Journey Through Hilinigmatic Terrain\" and that has the same shape as the statue that suddenly appeared in Dadaupa Gorge. Indeed, it is that \"Mystifying Megachurl\" that has left you confused about its origin, unable to understand its objective, and otherwise confuzzled. Perhaps the next time you visit the Divine Ingenuity Domain, you will have a chance to meet this unique Hilichurl once more?",
