  "description": "A woodcarving torso with a stick that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\" It is painted blue and reminds people of a forest stream.\\nNo fairy tale is complete without an Aranara elder. Like a giant tree in the forest, they use their wisdom to protect the little ones from the wind and rain. Most of them are amiable figures with a stick who stroke their beards as they tell stories within stories.",
