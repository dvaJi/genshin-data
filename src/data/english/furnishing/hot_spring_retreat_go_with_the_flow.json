  "description": "A modestly adorned semi-open structure, bearing a sign with instrument motifs, shares the same design as \"Djembe Studios.\"\\nThe store owner, Anchieta, believes that impulsive purchases should be avoided when choosing musical instruments. Hence, he chose a simple, unadorned decor style to create a stress-free shopping environment. In front of such an unassuming store, customers are less burdened by the psychological strain of trial or returns, and are more likely to find the perfect instrument for themselves.",
