  "description": "A roof that has \"Cider Lake Blue\" as its main color theme. This roof exudes a sense of purity and cleanliness, which helps customers to build the impression that \"the food here is clean and safe.\" Of course, the ingredients that Bernhard has purchased are indeed safe and fresh. \"Even Paimon, whose nose is even sharper than that of a Northland Hound, cannot for the life of her detect anything wrong. She was even worried that we might not be able to bring the best out of such good ingredients.\"\\n\"Not that she's got anything to worry about with me at the helm. She can just focus on hollering and shouting â€” you know, attracting more customers.\"",
