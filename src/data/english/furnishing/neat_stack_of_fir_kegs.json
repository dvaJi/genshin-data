  "description": "Kegs made from fir wood that have been neatly stacked on one another. Though such tidy organization is pleasing to the eye, the topmost kegs are a bit unstable.\\nIt goes without saying that workers must take extra care when moving the kegs to avoid accidentally cracking open any of the lids. Though the taste of the alcohol stored within these kegs is exceptionally good, getting stains out of clothing from a spill can be an absolute nightmare.",
