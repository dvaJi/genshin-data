  "description": "\"I wish that the weather won't be too hot on the days where I don't sleep well...\"\\nIf the young woman who struggled to sleep entered the desert on the first evening to observe the stars, she would struggle to return by the second afternoon. Whenever she passed the Wall of Samiel's gate in her ragged state, she would often find a golden leaf of a certain plant caught in her luggage or her hair. This gold frightened her a little, for if the sky was akin to the color of these leaves, that could only mean that the sunlight this day would be exceedingly strong â€” torment indeed for those who lacked physical strength yet still had to trek through the desert. Such was her fear that she would subconsciously walk around any such plants of this kind that she might pass by.",
