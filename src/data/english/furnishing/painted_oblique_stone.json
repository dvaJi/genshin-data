  "description": "Jagged rocks that may be found scattered amidst the sands. If you look at them from a specific angle, they may seem similar to a misshapen clay bottle, twisted this way and then at such a perilous angle that one might reasonably fear that it could fall and shatter by itself.\\nClay derived from such rocks are especially easy to color, making them a very popular material amongst practitioners of clay masonry.",
