  "description": "A storage shelf that is a common sight in Inazuman stores. It has been made from dark-painted Aralia Wood.\\nThe side frames and rear panels of such containers come fitted with spliced tongues and grooves, from which each grid panel may be disassembled and reorganized, thus allowing one to freely section parts of the shelf off.\\nMost Inazuman storefronts suffer from a lack of space, so these modular shelf designs that can be used to \"play any role\" are most practical indeed.",
