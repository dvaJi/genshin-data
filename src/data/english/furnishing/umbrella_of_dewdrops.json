  "description": "A plant that grows in the silent rainforest. Its round, umbrella-shaped leaves and its vivid green coloration really reflect its vitality.\\nCompared to other round-leaved plants of its kind, the corners of its leaves seem to facilitate the formation of dew drops. Occasionally, a mild-tempered animal might wait beside it to sip a drop of sweetness from a leaf.",
