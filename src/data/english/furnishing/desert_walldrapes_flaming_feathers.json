  "description": "These intricately-crafted and elegantly-shaped wall drapes remind one of a Sacred Ibis' burning-red feathers. They are one of Aaru Village's most representative handicrafts. However, they cannot be produced in large quantities and are therefore not for sale. The drapes were originally designed by an old artisan, who in their last days sought to pour all their life's experience into this piece of experimental work. As such, it ended up on a wall in the village chief's house — as a memento and also a source of inspiration for young artisans. In spite of the scorching heat in the desert, one can always find a sweet pool of water inside their heart so long as they do not give up aiming higher.",
