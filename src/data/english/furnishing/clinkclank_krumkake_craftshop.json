  "description": "A building modeled after Aino's workbench. Though almost identical in appearance, this building is stripped of its original function.\\nThe Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop only ever receives cast-off scraps that no one else desires, but Aino still manages to repurpose them for workshop upgrades. \"I can make them into flowers...\" she says. And so, her workshop has become the most vibrant presence in that area.",
