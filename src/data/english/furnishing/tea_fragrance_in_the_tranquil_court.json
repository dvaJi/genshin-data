  "description": "A building that has utilized a blue-toned mosaic glass dome. The dome's metal frame fits perfectly with the building's stone foundations, offering the structure both stability and beauty. The entire structure's surface area, height, and the shape of its four foundational pillars have been carefully considered to ensure the muted passage of wind. Just lay out a table for tea in the courtyard, and one can enjoy its beauty alongside the steeped goodness of said tea.",
