  "description": "A hanging rack adorned with packages and Flamegranate shells, constructed from branches of \"Ashen Aratiku Tree,\" usually found near the Courier's Longhouse.\\nIt is said that although packages made from Flamegranate shells are popular within Natlan, foreign visitors often distrust these explosive Flamegranate shell packages, preferring traditional packaging methods. Consequently, the Courier's Longhouse employs this rack to display various types of packages, allowing senders to choose according to their preferences, thereby aiming to maximize efficiency.",
