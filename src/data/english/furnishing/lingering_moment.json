  "description": "A wondrous picture frame created using the best Cuihua Wood available. The canvas has been steeped in paints saturated with Sub-Space Creation energies and has become exceedingly supple. It also has the unique ability to resonate with you and implant precious memories upon its surface.\\nAfter meeting certain friends you invited into your Serenitea Pot, Tubby thought long and hard before preparing these picture frames for you. \"The unforgettable moments that you spent together may have been the greatest gift of all,\" she says.",
