  "description": "A pot made by Arapacati.\\nThe Aranara hold a primal fear of fire. Only Arapacati's brothers dare to approach fire due to their fascination about a Nara tradition known as cooking. To protect them from getting burned by the dancing flames, Arapacati invented this pot.\\nWhen future Nara friends come to future Festival Utsava, they should be able to enjoy some more palatable dishes then.",
