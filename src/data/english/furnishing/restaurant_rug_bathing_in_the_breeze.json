  "description": "This rectangular rug is found in the restaurants and hotels of the Court of Fontaine. Its design is composed of distinct layers of brilliant blue interwoven with finely cut golden patterns. It is said that this carpet adopted Fontaine Research Institute's latest results on color research, allowing its users to feel cool and refreshed like they are bathing in a cool lakeside breeze. Such a rug should certainly guarantee brisk business on a hot summer afternoon, right?",
