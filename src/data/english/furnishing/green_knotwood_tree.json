  "description": "Save for a few rare and precious tree types, the people of Liyue are accustomed to using broad-reaching collective terms for trees and aren't so fussy about the exact species of tree included. For example, trees with curved trunks are referred to by the more sophisticated-sounding term \"Knotwood.\"\\nThe Green Knotwood Tree is not a particularly rare sight. In the hot summer months, you can always find people sitting in its shade to escape the harsh sun.",
