  "description": "A small, round shrub dotted with brightly colored flowers, often transplanted and pruned as a potted plant.\\nIt is said to absorb elemental particles from the air, which in turn attracts Crystalflies, who come to perch on its branches.\\nHowever, Flower Shop owner Flora says that her experiments in this area have not succeeded. She suspects it is simply a rumor spread by merchants to bump up the prices of the potted plants they sell.",
