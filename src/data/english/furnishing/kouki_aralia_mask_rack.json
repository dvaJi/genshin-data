  "description": "A rack made of fine-quality Aralia Wood that is hung with various fox masks. The fox masks on such racks are not for sale, but are voluntarily donated by some residents.\\nThere are many folk tales about fox masks in Inazuma folklore, and one of the stories claims that people may buy a \"destined\" fox mask at a key festival, and that the mask will help them fulfill a wish. However, the person needs to return the mask after their wish is fulfilled. The journey to the shrine to return the mask was too far, so people set up such a rack in the city.\\nHence, perhaps each mask on this rack symbolizes the recent good fortune of an Inazuman.",
