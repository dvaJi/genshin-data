  "description": "A large residential building commonly found in the territories of the Masters of the Night-Wind, featuring distinctive curved chimneys.\\nThe Masters of the Night-Wind are renowned across Natlan for their mastery of various arcane arts, which involve burning herbs or incense for banishing and purification in practices such as divination, meditation, or healing. In everyday life, the tribe uses incense to ensure cleanliness and comfort in their living spaces. Thus, chimneys are a common sight on nearly all buildings within the tribe's domain.",
