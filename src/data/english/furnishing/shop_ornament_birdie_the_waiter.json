  "description": "This ornament, hung in a very visible spot at the storefront, is decorated with two rows of cute, small colored flags — an exquisitely-made gift from Barbara.\\n\"Barbara hopes that these little ornaments will contribute to the festive cheer, and they sure have been effective! Even the birds that often wreak havoc on the roof seem to have been infected by this atmosphere, becoming quite docile indeed.\"\\n\"Paimon appears to have gotten some inspiration from these flags regarding the birds that have come to rest on our roof.\"\\n\"Paimon has started to... reason with the birds (especially the few that had teased her before), requesting that they line up like waiters to give customers the impression that they are being given a grand welcome.\"\\n\"The birds did not acknowledge Paimon's request, flying away instead. It seems that her bird-speech could use a bit more work.\"",
