  "description": "A Brightwood ceiling decorated with a standard geometric pattern. Compared to wall panels and floorboards full of curved patterns, the straight and angular relief carvings add a sense of solemnity to the building's interior. It seems to be reminding people that, while inspiration is crucial, sound logic is just as important when it comes to the pondering of difficult questions.",
