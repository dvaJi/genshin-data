  "name": "Amber Pearlroot Tree",
  "description": "Save for certain trees with special nobility, the people of Liyue are more used to naming vegetation based on their morphology as opposed to their precise species. Thus, it was to these trees with pale branches that they gave the name \"Pearlroot.\"\\nThe wood pulp made from Amber Pearlroot Trees is quite thick and can be processed into large amounts of paper. Most of the cheap paper on the market is made from this kind of wood.",
