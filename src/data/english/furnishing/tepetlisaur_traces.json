  "description": "A type of rock that can be found all over Natlan. When Tepetlisaurs travel the land, they often leave behind solid Phlogiston in the earth they dig up. These rocks remind particularly poetic graffiti enthusiasts of Tepetlisaurs in both color and texture, and so this phenomenon was named \"Tepetlisaur Traces.\"",
