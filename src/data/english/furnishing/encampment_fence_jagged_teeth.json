  "description": "A fence like the ones used in the Kujou Encampment. Fences of this kind are usually constructed in haste using leftover wood from building barracks, gates, and defensive works, plus whatever wood may be found nearby. Having jagged, irregular heights is something of a common occurrence in such cases, showcasing the strict prioritization of construction material usage in the Shogun's Army.",
