  "description": "These steps were once upon a time exceedingly sturdy and smooth, but under the ravages of time and the destruction caused by sandstorms, potholes have begun to appear in its original smooth surface, while some of the tiles have also come loose, thus now necessitating much care when you step on them.\\nBecause the slopes on either side of these steps are often filled with fine sand, thus making them rather slippery indeed, children will sometimes use them as slides. On the other hand, such slopes can prove very frustrating indeed for Sumpter Beasts carrying heavy loads.",
