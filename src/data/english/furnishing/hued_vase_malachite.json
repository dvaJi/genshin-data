  "description": "This type of exquisite glazed pottery has intricate malachite patterns painted on its white, almost jade-like surface, being in no way inferior to even the best utensils across Teyvat.\\nWith glazed pottery becoming increasingly pedestrian, such a utensil has gradually become an object that embodies incredible beauty that can be perceived and admired by the general public. Given that its practicality, aesthetics, and affordability are perfectly balanced, people tend to bring it along as a gift when visiting family and friends.\\nIt is said that a famous dancer at Zubayr Theater once paid a visit to the pottery shop and gazed at the amazing assortment of colorful pottery. Some theater fans thus reckoned that the dancer was fond of exquisite pottery pieces, and together, they purchased a large number of luxurious pottery vases as a gift to the theater to show their support. In the end, all the vases were returned, and the dancer, together with everyone at Zubayr Theater, wrote a thank-you letter to the fans, briefly explaining the whole story: the dancer was trying to grasp the beauty of the pottery's form by observing its colors and patterns, rather than wanting to purchase the pottery itself.",
