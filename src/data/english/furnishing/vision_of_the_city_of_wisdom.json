  "description": "A tower-like building made of thick tiles and tough wood that may be found within Sumeru. Other than withstanding the momentum of an enraged Sumpter Beast's charge, it can also block repeated impacts from heavy arrows. A watchtower with small observation ports has been mounted atop it, sacrificing some of the view in exchange to ensure better protection for any troops within. However, the rainforest today is a rather peaceful place, so few people will be stationed in these towers for long.",
