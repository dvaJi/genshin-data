  "description": "This utensil is made from delicate clay and fired into shape by a master craftsman. With a simple and efficient design, it can easily be paired with wooden tables and chairs.\\nIt's been said that some teapots made from such clay have metal liners in them that reduce their capacity to retain the heat. However, with the proper spices placed within them, they can also make unpalatable potions easier to swallow. Due to this, some children have begun to subconsciously associate these utensils with doctors and Forest Rangers.",
