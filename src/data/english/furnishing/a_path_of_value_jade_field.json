  "description": "An orderly field that is saturated with Sub-Space Creation energy. The fertile soil has almost unlimited nutrition, and thus seeds planted here will grow into excellent crops in time without much need for intensive care. However, crops placed here will tend to put long roots down, so you cannot put too many crops in here if you wish to give them all sufficient room to grow.\\nThe following seeds, spores, and samples obtained from the Seed Dispensary may be planted here: Valberry, Sweet Flower, Small Lamp Grass, Jueyun Chili, Carrot, Radish, Mint, Mushroom, Harra Fruit, Zaytun Peach, Marcotte, Grainfruit, Cacahuatl, Saurian Claw Succulent, Quenepa Berry, Glowing Hornshroom.",
