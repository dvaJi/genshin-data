  "description": "A claw-snapping crab that can be found in various water bodies throughout Teyvat.\\nThese crabs have blue-gray shells and are more docile and less prone to anger than other crab species. Their limbs, however, are of greater strength. Getting pinched by one of their claws is definitely going to hurt. Tubby can attest to that. Having being pinched once before, she has sworn never to provoke the crabs ever again.",
