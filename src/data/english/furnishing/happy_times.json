  "description": "After Paimon and Tubby had a talk about Merusea Village, the latter combined the former's descriptions with her own imagination to create this stone covered in strange plants.\\nThis giant stone is very smooth and solid, and its surface is exceedingly flat, almost as if it were machine-processed. It is perfect for meals, work, or play... though not all three at once, owing to the limited space available.",
