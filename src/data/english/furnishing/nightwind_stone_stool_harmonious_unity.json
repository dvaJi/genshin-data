  "name": "Night-Wind Stone Stool: Harmonious Unity",
  "description": "A special stone stool built low and wide, and lined with purple fabric. It is a staple in the houses of the Masters of the Night-Wind, who often adopt a cross-legged posture when meditating to better achieve unity of body and mind. As such, many chairs in the tribe take on the form of backless stone stools. These provide a stable, spacious sitting surface while requiring users to engage their core, helping maintain focus and reduce external distractions.",
