  "description": "A small bookcase often seen in the Palais Mermonia that can be used to store all kinds of reference books that are quite helpful to the staff in their work. It is said that due their relatively small size, lightweight and portable construction, and ease of use, the staff of the Palais Mermonia have taken to calling this small case their toolbox for fixing the Court of Fontaine, and they take it with them even when moving. Thus, it has gained the honorary moniker of \"Little Helper.\"",
