  "description": "A tawny pottery piece that has undergone more delicate surface treatment, allowing its subtle textures to be better presented. Its durability against both high and low temperatures, as well as bumps, has also been significantly increased. This is all thanks to the introduction of techniques from Liyue. After the Akademiya set restrictions on the price of clay, merchants had to discover other ways to make profits. Some of them had traveled afar to Liyue and noticed the similarities in the production between Liyue porcelain and Sumeru pottery. Hence, they spent a fortune purchasing the technical know-how behind Liyue-style porcelain, which later took Sumeru pottery into a brand new era. Of course, the pottery pieces made with such techniques were branded as imported luxury items by these merchants. The necessary techniques were not uploaded via the Akademiya to the Akasha System, which explains why glazed pottery was not a household item in the beginning.",
