  "description": "An incredible creature that absorbs the faint energy radiating from jade to stay alive.\\nWhen motionless, it is sometimes mistaken for jade by careless adventurers, hence the moniker, \"Malachitin.\"\\nAfter arriving in The Realm Within, their desire to locomote has been greatly increased by the high concentration of adeptal energy, and the range across which they roam has increased correspondingly, so they often seem to disappear. Perhaps only a teapot spirit such as Tubby has a hope of tracking their whereabouts.",
