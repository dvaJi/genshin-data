  "description": "An Inazuman home with a simple structure that can also be used as a storefront. It is simply and inexpensively made, and rent is thus cheap even in prime real estate locations within Inazuma City, which is very suited indeed to people new to the mercantile business, such as the owner of Netsuke no Gen Crafts. However, the flaw of such stores is also quite plain to see, which is that they lack storage space and thus require frequent supplies of goods, which puts some pressure on the store owner. As such, situations where supply cannot meet demand occur from time to time.",
