  "description": "A bowl of water that one cleans one's hands with. It is often set up along the main path to the tea garden.\\nTo some Inazumans, carefully washing one's hands and settling one's breathing and state of mind before entering a tea room is a tradition of utmost importance â€” that way, they can achieve a form of \"purity of heart,\" which will allow them to fully experience the profound mysteries of the tea they shall taste.",
