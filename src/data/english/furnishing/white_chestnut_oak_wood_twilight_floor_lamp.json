  "description": "A floor lamp shaped like a water droplet, constructed with a sturdy \"White Chestnut Oak Wood\" frame, commonly placed within the \"People of the Springs\" to provide supplementary lighting.\\nCompared to lighting fixtures in other regions, the lamps in the \"People of the Springs\" are adjusted to emit a softer and more delicate light. It is said that this is because the chief believes that a softer, warmer lighting environment helps to slow down the pace of life. And a slower, more relaxed lifestyle is key to truly enjoying a holiday.",
