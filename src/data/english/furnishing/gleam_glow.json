  "description": "A lamp composed of a base and three floating bulbs. Its unique design takes inspiration from the lighting devices of Nasha Town.\\n\"How can they float and glow at the same time?\" The bulbs' levitation appears to have something to do with kuuvahki. It's the sort of curious creation that passing tourists frequently find fascinating.",
