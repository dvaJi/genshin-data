  "name": "Estate Courtyard Corner: Measured Harmony",
  "description": "This is a corner of the Refined Estate's corridor. According to the Inazuman way of designing one's courtyard, there must be some space between the outer perimeter of the walkways and the walls, such that various flora may be grown there. Trees are, for their part, planted within the inner perimeter. This minimizes the number of falling leaves that will float out of the courtyard and inconvenience the neighbors.",
