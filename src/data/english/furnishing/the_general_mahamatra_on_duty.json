  "description": "The briefcase used by the General Mahamatra Cyno has an approximately cylindrical cross section and has ornaments that signify its status. This briefcase can hold more documents and implements than the standard style that the Akademiya uses. Of course, the need to use so many objects in a single investigation indicates that the task is of such extreme complexity that only a few people in the Akademiya can accomplish it — chief among them, of course, being General Mahamatra Cyno.\\nThe briefcase's large size has also been an encumbrance: Every time Cyno leaves the house with this briefcase, he will invariably be spotted by various people, and word will quickly spread that \"the General Mahamatra is off on official duty,\" which can get in the way of his investigations. As such, Cyno often takes advantage of this notion by going out empty-handed and acting like he's not working, which can catch his targets off guard, or by taking the briefcase to the tavern to sit at a table for a long game of Genius Invokation TCG until any onlookers tire of watching him. With time, the briefcase has thus come to symbolize the \"unpredictable work hours of the General Mahamatra.\"",
