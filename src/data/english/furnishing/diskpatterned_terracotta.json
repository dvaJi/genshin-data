  "description": "Jagged rocks that may be found scattered amidst the sands. These are lined with coiling patterns. They are not particularly hard and can be broken open using an ordinary metal hammer. The material within can be used in the creation of earthenware and will greatly strengthen the finished product. In the past, such material would have been too precious for any artisan to pass up, but as craftsmanship has advanced, they no longer need to rely on the special materials within these rocks to produce sturdy pottery.",
