  "description": "An open-air stall featuring a distinctive sign in the shape of an Iktomisaurus. Brimming with liquid, its unique design makes the store's specialty unmistakable, even from afar. This liquid, the essence of a special beverage, must be exposed to direct sunlight for a prolonged period of time before it can reach its optimal flavor. Due to space constraints within the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, merchants had nowhere else to store these containers, so they placed them on the roofs of their stalls, creating a striking visual amidst the bustling crowds. Over time, this practice became Xocolatl Beverages' defining feature and has since been incorporated into the stall's permanent branding.",
