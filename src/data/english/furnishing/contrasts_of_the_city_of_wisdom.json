  "description": "A sturdy medium structure that evokes a sense of familiarity in people upon first glance. This building is commonly seen in Sumeru City, with many merchants and residents adopting similar designs.\\nRumor has it that some architectural researchers have once put forth a plan regarding making \"universal architecture.\" They intended to have buildings parted into modules and then freely assembled, allowing for varied functionality while still maintaining a unified aesthetic. Though this plan hasn't been fully adopted, its various benefits have been applied to newer buildings and the maintenance of older houses in Sumeru City.",
