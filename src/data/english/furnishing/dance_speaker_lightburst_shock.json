  "description": "A strikingly modern loudspeaker, this full-scale replica of the audio system from Tete Isle is renowned for its vivid sound and emotional impact. Its \"Lightburst Shock Mode\" in particular has been known to ignite the spirit and stir the soul. That said, even in normal mode, its output is deemed too overwhelming for the flora and fauna of the Serenitea Pot. Thus, it is usually only used as an ornament in the Serenitea Pot.",
