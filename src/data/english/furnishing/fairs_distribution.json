  "description": "An exceedingly durable cabinet hewn and carved from a single large stone, built in the same style as those sturdy ones in the Chuwen Fair. Although this stone cabinet has a limited number of compartments, each one boasts substantial capacity and impressive weight-bearing abilities. Whether it be weapons carried by warriors or goods carried by traders, all can be securely stored. Therefore, the Weary Inn has intentionally placed these stone cabinets in its guest rooms, providing travelers with a convenient place to temporarily store their luggage.",
