  "description": "A lightweight and convenient wood-carved cape that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the cape of the young Forest Watcher in Gandharva Ville who is also a talented botanist. There is one specific type of fairy tale that is not known for compelling plots or profound lessons. Instead, they focus on detailed introductions of all kinds of mushrooms and trees in Sumeru. These tales share a fixed way of storytelling: A mischievous Aranara discovers some unknown plants, and then comes the Aranara titled the Polymath who will patiently introduce the plants in an educational and entertaining manner.",
