  "description": "A woodcarving torso with a stick that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\" It is unpainted and has the unique texture and aroma of logs.\\nNo fairy tale is complete without an Aranara elder. Like a giant tree in the forest, they use their wisdom to protect the little ones from the wind and rain. Most of them are amiable figures with a stick who stroke their beards as they tell stories within stories.",
