  "description": "A shelf made from Karmaphala Wood with nine large clay pots snugly arranged on top. The tightly sealed clay pots are used for transporting liquid Sumeru specialties such as Zaytun Peach juice, spice extract, and fertilizers. Apart from keeping its contents safe for extended periods of time, there is one other purpose for these intricately designed clay pots â€” many customers would buy the clay pots along with their liquid goods, and some even inquired about better designs. Therefore, merchants have begun to regard these clay containers as goods as well, replacing the usual pots with all kinds of elegantly designed ones.",
