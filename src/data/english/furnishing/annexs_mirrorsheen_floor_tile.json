  "description": "The standard floor tile of the Illusory Annex using construction materials derived from Tearstone, made using selected underwater stones and fine beach sand. It is especially clean and bright, and from a certain angle, it almost seems to gleam like a mirror.\\nIt is said that if you were to tread on such flooring with footwear without friction, you might even feel, for a few minutes, the feeling of dancing alongside the Icewind Suite. Unfortunately, such dances are rarely a thing dancers can control, so it would be best to watch one's step and personal safety.",
