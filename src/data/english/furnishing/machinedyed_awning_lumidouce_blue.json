  "description": "A bulk-manufactured awning produced with the assistance of clockwork meka that, theoretically, should be in the royal purple-blue hue of a Lumidouce Bell. In reality, most of those who see it have the same reaction: \"It's obviously cyan!\"\\nThe reason for that is simple: When the clockwork meka was dyeing the material, a deviation occurred that never would have happened with human artisans. The clockwork meka used can only follow commands and repeat the production process, with no one to verify the final results of the dyeing process. The workers assembling the awnings afterward just followed their instructions and also failed to notice the color issue. When the designer finally saw the finished product, such a large quantity had already been produced as to making scrapping the project unfeasible. After making sure there were no quality issues, they were sold normally.\\nThis case became the subject of a paper from a certain research team at the Fontaine Research Institute, and subsequently became a key argument for the necessity of human supervision in clockwork meka-assisted production.",
