  "description": "Hands made from branches. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nAlthough branches aren't very... aesthetic, so to speak, and in fact, remind people of the legendary snow monsters, a certain Knight of Favonius once told the children this: when snow monsters see happy snowmen, even they will be infected by joy. No longer will they seek to scare people, but rather to make friends with everyone. Thus, snowmen with such branches for arms would come to be piled up in spots \"where snow monsters often appear.\"",
