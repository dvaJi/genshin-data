  "description": "An ordinary plant commonly seen in the wilds of Fontaine, the shrub adorns the landscape with a hue reminiscent of bellflowers. From a distance, it resembles wisps of smoke, earning it the nickname of Bellflower Haze among Fontaine's adventurers. Legend holds that its burning branches release a scent that repels nearby monsters, even affecting aquatic creatures. As a result, adventurers are generally prohibited by Fontaine authorities from using it as fuel.",
