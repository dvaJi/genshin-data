  "description": "The censer shaped like an Iktomisaurus is nearly the same height as an Iktomisaurus chick and is adorned with intricate graffiti-style paintings, making it suitable for both practical use and decoration. It is said that in certain mystical systems, spirituality is closely linked to an individual's mental world. When a novice attempts meditation or clairvoyance, the imagery of the surrounding environment can have unpredictable effects on their mental state, necessitating careful selection of the setting. Perhaps based on this concept, artisans designed this censer in the shape of an Iktomisaurus, aiming to have its visage accompany and protect the user, guiding them on the right path.",
