  "description": "These exterior walls, towering like mountains, can be found within Chenyu Vale. They effectively act as fire breaks among the narrow streets and valleys, preventing disaster and protecting the surrounding buildings. To better protect against fire, the walls are made of reliable brick and are designed to be taller than the roof.\\nOf course, as the saying goes, \"The wise take precautions before disaster strikes.\" Walls, no matter how sturdy, are not as reliable as fire prevention awareness. Planning ahead and preparing for different eventualities is key.",
