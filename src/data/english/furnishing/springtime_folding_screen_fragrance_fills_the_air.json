  "description": "A folding screen meticulously crafted from fine brocade, set within a high-quality Sandbearer Wood frame, which exudes a dignified simplicity and refined elegance. Among the many exquisite decorations showcased during the Lantern Rite, this screen stands out as a rare masterpiece.\\nThe brocade surface is adorned with motifs of bronze mirrors, white horses, gourds, and fishing rods. Paired with another similar screen, it forms a scene inspired by the Eight Adepts. A cluster of verdant bamboo has been embroidered in one corner of the screen, seeming to herald the arrival of spring and life's resurgence.",
