  "description": "An incredibly common cubic building block found throughout Constellation Metropole, it produces a \"boom-boom\" thumping sound when hit, earning it the nickname \"Boom-Boom Unit.\"\\nIt is said that the inspiration for these cubic construction units came from the building blocks beloved by children. When architects begin building homes, they need only select the \"units\" with the right functionalities to easily complete construction. This kind of building philosophy seems to exactly align with the concept of \"modularity\" currently espoused by Fontainian architects. Perhaps this is what is meant by the oft-repeated phrase \"The most advanced technologies are born from the most beautiful of fantasies.\"",
