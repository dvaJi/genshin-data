  "description": "A tall arbor with dense cyan leaves growing on it in multiple clusters, a feature that has caused them to be compared to interwoven clouds. They say that Onikabuto will make themselves nests amidst the leaf-clouds for their larvae, who have yet to grow their hard shells out, to rest. Adults often tell their children not to disturb these small Onikabuto and to let them experience peaceful childhoods instead.",
