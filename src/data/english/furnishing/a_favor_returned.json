  "description": "This flower vase has a fairly unique make that is far beyond your average porcelain vessel, but there is still some gap between this and a masterwork of any kind. It is not hard to guess that it was made by the hardworking artisans.\\nIf one were to trace the origins of this vase, one would find that its maker was an orphan who was only able to make it into adulthood thanks to the Yashiro Commission's aid. She was taken in by the very same artisan family who had received the Commission's help, and she had already become a fine craftswoman in her own right by the time she was a youth.",
