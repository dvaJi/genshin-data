  "name": "Tavern Dining Chair - \"Flavor's Multiplicity\"",
  "description": "A dining chair whose backrest and seating cushions are like trays of jelly. These are common seats seen at The Cat's Tail. According to what Margaret heard from Sara, if the backrests of seats have more flexibility, then when clients are savoring a dish, the additional movement might allow them to resonate with the flavors more. So, regardless if the customers order Mondstadt Grilled Fish or any assortments of snacks and desserts, sitting on this chair will improve their dining experience!",
