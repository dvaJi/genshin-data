  "description": "A sofa with unknown origins. It has an outstandingly soft back and bulky cushions enough to clear away your exhaustion the moment you sit on it. The fabric looks sleek and sturdy, and its color scheme seems to have followed a certain principle that allows it to look elegant and comfortable at the same time. Regardless of a room's pre-existing furnishing, placing one of these sofas is sure to give it a hint of luxury.",
