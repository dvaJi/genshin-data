  "description": "A shrub commonly found in the wilds of Natlan, known for its remarkable resilience. It can take root and sprout even in the most barren of fissures. Across the whole of Natlan, there are only two circumstances that could cause this type of shrub to disappear: firstly, if the soil itself was utterly incapable of supporting plant life; and secondly, if some external force was preventing its growth, such as an abundance of Abyssal power. For the flying squad, who carry out regular patrols all over the land, observing and promptly reporting changes in local vegetation is therefore an essential part of their daily duties.",
