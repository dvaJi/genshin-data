  "description": "A compactly-designed Inazuman dwelling that can be found in Watatsumi Island's Bourou Island. These buildings are often used as storehouses and their attics are particularly suited to storing coral branches.\\nThe commonly-found purple dyes and trace amounts of coral powder are mixed together and treated with strong alcohol such that they will turn into a vibrant rose-red under the sun — this is exactly the same color used in Watatsumi soldiers' uniforms. As such, some children of Bourou Village believe that samurai will gain the blessings of the sea corals within such buildings, granting them wondrous powers with which they can protect Watatsumi Island from invasion and harm.",
