  "description": "A simple, lightweight clay barbecue grill equipped with a Flammabomb Wood stand. Thanks to its portability, it can be carried and set up by a single person. It is said that in the wars of the past, people discovered that ordinary campfires were insufficient to feed an entire camp of soldiers, often resulting in food being undercooked or burned. Fortunately, the advent of these portable clay grills has largely alleviated such issues.",
