  "description": "A tabletop made of light-colored stone. The cross-section is trapezoidal and stable, and therefore the objects stacked on its surface will not wobble. Such tables are said to have been trampled by Sumpter Beasts with full loads without so much as a hint of structural damage, and that this is due to them having been used as defenses by the desert folk. Against a calamity that swept in from the depths of the desert, soldiers once used these structures to build a sturdy defensive position, where they held for a long while until they ran out of supplies and were at last forced to retreat. Nonetheless, the fortifications built purely on rock and sand have survived, and the design of those parapets is the inspiration for this table.",
