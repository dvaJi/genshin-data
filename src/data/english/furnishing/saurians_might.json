  "description": "A magnificent model horn, meticulously crafted to replicate the grand metal horns used in the Collective of Plenty.\\nIt is said that when this horn is blown, it produces a sound both powerful and awe-inspiring. Perhaps due to its commanding presence, it has become a symbol of honor bestowed upon wrestling champions. Its mighty bellow, reverberating throughout the tribe, praises the victor's strength, they who are as mighty as the Tatankasaurs.",
