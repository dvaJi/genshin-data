  "description": "The street lamps that stand on either side of the Grand Narukami Shrine's torii gates and shrine buildings. It is said that the lights of these lamps are key to the Guuji Yae's secret art of reading the hearts of others and that those who approach with ill-intent will have their wicked thoughts reflected onto them as the lights shine on their faces, causing them to fall upon their knees and repent, unable to enter the shrine. But for those who approach with earnest hearts and heartfelt wishes, these are naught but ordinary street lights.",
