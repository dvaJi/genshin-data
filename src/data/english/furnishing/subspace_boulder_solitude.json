  "description": "A Sub-Space Boulder that hangs high in the air. Its core is made of Plaustrite unique to Liyue and it is made by casting rock masses into a moderately-sized floating platform. Its dimensions are just right to fit one house atop it, all the better to enjoy ascetic solitude in the skies. Placing many of these together and adjusting them by height might even help you build a stone stairway to heaven.",
