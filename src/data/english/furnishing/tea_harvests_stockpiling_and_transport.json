  "description": "A simple and lightweight bamboo basket that is durable and suited for the air-drying and storage of tea leaves. Tea leaves contain significant amounts of moisture before being roasted, and storing them directly in a sealed container can easily affect their flavor. Therefore, tea farmers and merchants have specifically chosen lightweight, breathable bamboo baskets. This reduces the weight and makes the leaves easy to transport on the one hand, and helps maintain the flavor on the other. Two birds with one stone, indeed.",
