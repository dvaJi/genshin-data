  "description": "This ornament, hung in a very visible spot at the storefront, features artwork of food, showing that Favonian Goodies is a snack shop.\\n\"Paimon suddenly realized that if the food displayed doesn't match what they really look like, our customers might get upset, so she thought that she should try making the color of our snacks particularly vibrant.\"\\n\"But to think that this process actually made our products taste better â€” talk about a fluke!\"\\n\"Paimon was quite pleased with herself too, saying 'Paimon told you that food that looks good definitely tastes good too!'\"\\n\"In truth, Paimon did try making her own fancy Fisherman's Toast, only for it to be hair-raisingly sweet. Fortunately, she scarfed it all down herself, or I fear that even Good Hunter's chef might have come after us for that travesty.\"",
