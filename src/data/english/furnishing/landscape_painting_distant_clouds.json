  "description": "This painting was found on the roof by a windmill keeper, and its illustration of the sky and the flowing clouds in a few mere strokes was of great value to all art connoisseurs.\\nIn the absence of the original artist, the Mora earned from auctioning it off was donated to the church and the Knights of Favonius, all the better to help fund the organization of the Windblume Festival each year.",
