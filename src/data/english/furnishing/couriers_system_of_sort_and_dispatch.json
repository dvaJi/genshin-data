  "description": "A shelf displaying an array of packages, crafted from the lightweight yet reliable \"Ashen Aratiku Wood,\" can be found near the \"Courier's Longhouse.\"\\nIt is said that some administrators, when dispatching items, categorize them into standard and special packages based on their importance. Standard packages are placed in mailboxes and sent out in batches after sorting, while special packages are displayed on such shelves and entrusted to dedicated couriers. Clients of special packages can even request specific couriers, including a certain legendary \"Saurian Hunter.\" Of course, the \"cost\" of such requests is another story altogether...",
