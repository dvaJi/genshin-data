  "description": "A claw-snapping crab that can be found in various water bodies throughout Teyvat.\\nIt has a purple shell that resembles the emblem of the Shogunate. It also is also quite Shogun-like in its fearless, dominant movements. Such arrogance! Such impertinence! \\nBut in the Realm Within, they may end up meeting other animals that they have never seen before, like rampaging beasts or fierce hounds. It is said that you can catch General Crabs play-fighting with these creatures, which is quite the thrilling sight to see!",
