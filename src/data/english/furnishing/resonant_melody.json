  "description": "A uniquely designed harp. Its form is plated with luxurious gold lacquer, and its workmanship is exquisite. The strings have been fashioned marvelously, such that they can store music for a long time. All one needs to do is touch its strings, and those splendid musical phrases will re-emerge perfectly.\\nMany talented performers will modify the instrument in their hands according to their own personal habits. This instrument may seem like a mere decoration to the average person, but perhaps some master might actually be able to use it in a performance.",
