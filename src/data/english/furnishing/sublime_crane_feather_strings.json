  "name": "Sublime Crane Feather Strings",
  "description": "An elegant Liyue zither featuring a slender body and peg protectors shaped like crane feathers. Made with wood of only the finest quality and inlaid with exquisite gilded designs.\\nThe lustre of the strings seems to shine, each one tough and durable, with treble notes ringing clear as water and its bass bold and forceful. When played lightly, it is like a breeze on a cloudy night whistling through the mountains. When played with vigor, it is as though a great battle is being waged with golden weapons hidden beneath each string. Gentleness and strength are coupled as one, and within this instrument is contained both poetry and power.",
