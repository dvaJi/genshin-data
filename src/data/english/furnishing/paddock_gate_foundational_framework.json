  "description": "A wooden gate constructed from leftover Flammabomb Wood, offering low cost and durability. They say that it is sturdy enough to effectively withstand a saurian's charge. Despite its simple structure, the requirement for it to be made from leftover materials puts the craftsman's foundational skills to the test. As a result, when training new artisans, many tribes choose to have apprentices start by crafting such gates.",
