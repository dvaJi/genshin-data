  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Molten Lava Pool.\\nA peculiar type of fish with a single horn. Round and firm, its belly is as bouncy as a balloon.\\nThe horn-shaped crystals that grow on the head have some similarities to solid phlogiston, but research indicates that these \"horns\" are clear and sparkling when they are newly hatched, like polished glass. But after living in a liquid phlogiston environment for an extended period, the accumulation of numerous colored substances causes the current colorful appearance, and gives rise to their joking nickname of \"Phony Phlogiston.\"\\nEvery few years, the \"Phony Phlogiston\" crystal on the Unihornfish's head will slough off fragments as it grows, and these fragments are incredibly precious ingredients for creating dyes. Graffiti aficionados consider them to capture the \"color of flame.\"",
