  "description": "This unique table from the Inazuma region that has a charcoal firepit built in. It is specially useful during winter. Due to its warmth and coziness, it is said that it will \"swallow\" people up. But after the Raiden Shogun got rid of the main threat in Inazuma, every winter would be frostbitten and bone-chilling. Therefore, the climate in Inazuma has been relatively mild for hundreds of years, and the kotatsu has not come into use as it was designed. Some families in better conditions would put ice cubes in the box instead to create a cooling atmosphere on hot summer days.",
