  "description": "A lush and demure plant with brightly colored flowers. The color of their petals is a sign: these plants are very sensitive and won't bloom if the soil contains even trace amounts of harmful substances. Therefore, the root range of this plant is an indicator of an area of soil that can support the healthy growth of most plants.",
