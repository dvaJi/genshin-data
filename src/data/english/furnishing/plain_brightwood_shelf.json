  "description": "This storage shelf is made from high-quality Brightwood. Its structure is simple, sturdy, and long-lasting — storing large amounts of goods is well within its ability. Its design takes some cues from the peculiarities of Sumeru construction — its doors are not rectangular, and the artisans have also added the ability to quickly assemble and disassemble it for easy transport.",
