  "description": "A type of street lamp that is often seen in Petrichor. It uses a cheap but sturdy Mallow Wood pole, guaranteeing durability while also simplifying the structure. This also makes it easy for the residents to use and maintain. It has a metal cover with a flared shape like a trumpet, not only for aesthetic appeal but also to enhance the illumination provided, ensuring the safety of nighttime travelers.",
