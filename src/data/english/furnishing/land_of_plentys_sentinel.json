  "description": "A finely crafted, two-tiered wooden watchtower constructed from durable Flammabomb Wood and equipped with a specialized sunshade, allowing for prolonged occupancy. Legend tells of how these watchtowers were originally erected in the Collective of Plenty to facilitate the long-term observation of volcanic activity, providing early eruption warnings. However, over time, it was discovered that they were far more effective for observing the terrain below rather than higher elevations. As a result, these structures have since been repurposed for monitoring farmland as well.",
