  "description": "A street lamp crafted from sturdy and reliable \"White Chestnut Oak Wood\" found within the \"People of the Springs.\" It is relatively short in height and features a unique lampshade shaped like a harpoon.\\nIt is said that this design originates from a past custom of resisting Abyssal invasions â€” some guards would patrol at night with torches on harpoons or spears. Thus, the lampshade is shaped like a spearhead, and its hanging height is conveniently within reach of most adults, reminiscent of those times.",
