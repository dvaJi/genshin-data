  "description": "A furnishing device created by an unknown adeptus, who sent a sample of it and the requisite blueprint in a package to Tubby on an auspicious date. The device's exterior very much resembles the tea bowl lid-wearing Chubby, and its puffy, fluffy form is very cute indeed. The tea bowl is uniquely constructed, and you've heard that it contains all manner of adeptal materials that give it a mysterious tenacity, such that you can reach rather high heights when jumping atop it. In that regard, this item is quite similar to certain curious objects that one may find in Teyvat, which likely played a role in Tubby applying the \"Leisure Device\" appellation to it.\\nUnlike the wandering, much-traveled Chubby, Tubby claims to \"not be very accustomed to exercise,\" and is not often seen away from The Realm Within, and can be instead found within it at all times, taking a nap. Only when there is little going on within the Serenitea Pot does she venture out at times to chat and have tea with old friends. As such... one might say that Tubby will likely not use this device.",
