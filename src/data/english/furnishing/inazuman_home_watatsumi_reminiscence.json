  "description": "An Inazuman dwelling with an unusual color, which can be found in Bourou Village on Watatsumi Island. The roof uses a unique dye that is said that originated in the blue and purple plants found only on the island — the villagers would gather up dry grass and fallen leaves and maximize their use, and thus they would use \"the years the grass and leaves have witnessed\" to paint the roofs of their homes. Today, the dye-work is a lot less troublesome and certainly lacks the weight of those early days, but the people of Bourou Village have never stopped being fond of this color, which has become a hallmark of Watatsumi in its own right.",
