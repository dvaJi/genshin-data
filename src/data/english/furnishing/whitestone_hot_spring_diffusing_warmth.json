  "description": "The open-air hot spring built of smooth white stones is a great place to wash away your fatigue and relax your mind and body.\\nInazuma originally did not have natural hot springs, and the boiler-heated hot springs that were introduced by the Kanjou Commission have costs a tad too high for the common citizen to enjoy often.\\nTherefore, some talented craftsmen made full use of the art of space planning to create hot springs that do not require huge boilers. As it turns out, charcoal-fired boilers in the rocks around the hot springs can achieve the purpose of maintaining the water temperature just fine. Although the water temperature is not as warm as the imported hot spring design, it is nonetheless quite popular among civilians.",
