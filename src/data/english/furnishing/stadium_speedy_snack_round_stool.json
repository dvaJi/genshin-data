  "name": "Stadium \"Speedy Snack\" Round Stool",
  "description": "Small, cheap, and mass-production-friendly round stone stools that can be found in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame's Chuwen Fair, Xocolatl Beverages, and other places, mostly positioned near a bar or a square table. Some Stadium vendors focus on providing fast-food services, especially on tournament days or during events when customer traffic surges and seating demand increases. To meet this need despite space constraints, they prefer small, cost-effective stools over traditional cushioned or backrest-equipped chairs. They are hardly as comfortable as those decked-out chairs, but they are sufficient for customers who mainly aim to eat quickly and return to watching the event, making the lack of comfort a minor issue.",
