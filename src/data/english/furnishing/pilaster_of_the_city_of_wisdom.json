  "description": "A pillar that often may be found in Sumeru, joining two walls together. Being a key load-bearing structure, it was initially meant to use a metal frame which made it quite costly. As the classic curved wall began to grow in popularity, artisans found new ways to use wood joinery to replace the metal load-bearing pillars, thus lowering the cost of building the full set of wall structures.",
