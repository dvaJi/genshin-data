  "description": "A shed with a Karmaphala Wood structure. It was first used as a fruit vendor's stall. The fabric on the top seems commonplace, but it is actually an application of the Amurta school's research findings. According to these findings, prolonged exposure to sunlight and long-term storage in the darkness may both cause a loss of key flavors in fruits and vegetables. Based on this knowledge, Amurta school's researchers studied the properties of different textiles before selecting one that had optimum translucency. They then recommended that sheds be topped by such textiles for vendors to ensure minimum flavor loss during sales. Fruit and vegetable vendors found such sheds quite helpful. Many other shop owners would later begin to use them as well.",
