  "description": "A hut made from a lightweight Ashen Aratiku Wood frame, perfectly sized to accommodate a small stall, that can be seen throughout Chuwen Fair.\\nThe fabric used for its awning has been specially dyed a deep indigo, chosen for its ability to extend the shelf life of perishable goods such as fruit and vegetables, making it ideal for merchants selling such items. It is also said that indigo symbolizes tranquility and wisdom, which is why some artisans selling handmade jewelry also choose this type of hut.",
