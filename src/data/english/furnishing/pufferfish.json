  "description": "A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the Pool of Sapphire Grace.\\nRound and short pelvic fins, a plump body, and a plain face make up most people's first impression of the pufferfish. This is by and large an accurate assessment of its character as well: dull, slow, and lazy. However, few people know that this rather silly exterior hides a killer technique — this fish is capable of sucking water into its body before expelling it like a cannonball from its mouth with such force and pinpoint accuracy that even fishermen might be stunned by it. Truly, it is a first-rate killer in the water.\\n\"Pufferfish ahead? Watch for spittle!\" — Angler's Atlas, Pufferfish Chapter",
