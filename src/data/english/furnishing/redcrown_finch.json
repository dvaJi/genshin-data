  "description": "The Redcrown Finch is a small songbird with a beautiful voice that's commonly found in Fontaine.\\nHowever, despite its cute and kindly appearance, the Redcrown Finch is very aggressive and sometimes even attacks other birds that approach it too quickly. But young birds who have yet to fully grow their characteristic feather crest are devoid of fighting spirit, seeming confused and somewhat ignorant.\\nFortunately, due to the lack of natural enemies in the Serenitea Pot, the Redcrown Finch's aggressiveness has gradually waned since moving in. Now, the most they do is have friendly competitions with other animals, but no animals come to any harm.",
