  "description": "An ordinary chair made of Mallow Wood that can be commonly seen throughout Petrichor. The primary feature of this type of chair is its folding support. This design also allows the user to adjust the seat height within a given range or even store the entire rack to save space and make it more portable. It is said that since Petrichor is relatively remote, the demand for chairs is correspondingly low. However, outside guests must still be taken care of, so convenient seats that are easily foldable and storable, and may be taken out and adjusted when a customer comes were created to meet this need.",
