  "description": "A tour balloon fashioned after the \"Nochtli,\" its robust frame far exceeds that of an ordinary hot-air balloon, and its aggressive design evokes the image of a tyrant patrolling its airborne domain. Legend holds this is a life-size replica of the fearsome vehicle once ridden by \"El Capoctus Joquiratto\" during his reign over Villa Guiztli.\\nNow, however, Easybreeze Holiday Resort plans to repurpose this menacing vessel as the official mascot of the town. After all, with the villain defeated, even his wicked steed has become oddly endearing.\\nRumor has it that this balloon will one day appear alongside the beloved \"Mora Chocolate\" in a grand event at Villa Guiztli. Stay tuned.",
