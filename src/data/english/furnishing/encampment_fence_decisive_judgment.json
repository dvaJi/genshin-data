  "description": "A fence made in the style of the Kujou Encampment. The wooden piles gradually increase in height from the two sides of the fence towards the center, which makes for quite the unique configuration.\\nThey say that Kujou Sara once mapped out the ideal long-range shooting positions for both the resistance and the Kujou Encampment by analyzing detailed maps and real-time scouting reports. She then placed these fences along routes along which arrows were sure to come whistling in, forming excellent wood-usage-efficient barriers to their path.\\nAttacks from low arc would be directly blocked by the fence, while high-arcing arrows would bounce off the sloping roof of the barracks.",
