  "description": "One of the bookcases that may be found within the Yashiro Commission Headquarters. It is said that the other two commissions make infrequent use of these as well.\\nThis type of bookcase is quite tall indeed and consumes nearly 90 percent more wood than standard bookcases, which has greatly increased its capacity to the point where it can hold a veritable sea of tomes and other vessels while not taking up much more space than the average bookcase. It is somewhat more expensive, of course, but so what?",
