  "description": "\"When you stare at certain stars, the contours of their light will change before you know it...\"\\nAfter getting used to a life of expeditions and camping out in the wild, the sleepless young woman attempted to finish drawing her star maps in the first half of the night, before riding the wave of academic satisfaction and exhaustion to sleep. In her weary, groggy state, she found that the leaves of a certain plant resembled the contours of starlight that appeared after one observed distant stars for long periods of time. As such, she began to use the leaves of this plant to assist in drawing larger observation maps — a measure that met with unexpected success.",
