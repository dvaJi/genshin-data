  "description": "A fence built using Aralia Wood. Though they call it a \"fence,\" the gaps between each section are so large that even a grown man could slip between them with ease. As such, these fences are but a boundary marker at best.\\nA certain superintendent of the Police Station once said that such fences were only meant to send a message to the people. If even the Police Station had to be walled and fenced all-around with a double guard all year round, then would this not indicate that Inazuma City's security at large was woefully lacking? On the other hand, should the fences be open on all sides, even seeming nigh defenseless, the people would have confidence that the city's security was well in hand. I mean, there's no way the walls could have been constructed this way due to an oversight... Right?",
