  "description": "An experimental universal door frame made of metal that can be seen in Poisson.\\nIt was initially designed by someone who claimed to be an engineer, declaring that it could meet the needs of loading and unloading goods, naval navigation, and daily life, with freely adjustable height and width as well.\\nWhen not in use, it could function as a regular door frame or a hanger. When in use, the relevant goods could be placed directly under it to then be lifted.\\nHowever, the load-bearing capacity of the door frame could not meet the lifting requirements, and its loading and unloading efficiency proved unsatisfactory. The rate at which the device rusted when exposed to moisture for prolonged periods also exceeded initial expectations, with the potential for additional maintenance costs to arise in the future...\\nTaking these various factors into account, the residents of Poisson decided to ask the overly confident engineer to leave after settling the payment.\\nThe manufactured prototypes were not directly discarded, however. Instead, the townspeople repurposed them into public amenities.",
