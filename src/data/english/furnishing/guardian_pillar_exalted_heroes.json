Mostly found above the entrances to the various major zones within the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, they stand as symbols of the countless heroes of Natlan's past.\\nAs depicted on the so-called Wall of Despair, it was by the valiant efforts of the heroes that Natlan's path was carved, opening up the way forward for the generations to come. May all be inspired by their great deeds, and the young ones follow courageously in their footsteps.",
