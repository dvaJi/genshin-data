  "description": "A wine jar protected by a casing made of bamboo that can be commonly seen all across Liyue.\\nWinemakers choose a cave of just the right humidity level and store the jars away for several years, resulting in fine wines enjoyed by thirsty patrons.\\nThere is a constant risk of the wine jars rattling and breaking during transport, so the jars are always handled together with their bamboo frames.",
