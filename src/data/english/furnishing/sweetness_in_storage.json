  "description": "A container built with a large pottery jar and a parasol. It is a \"lowest-cost storage solution\" born from the joint efforts of researchers from Vahumana and Amurta, and is intended for fruit and vegetable vendors. Mist Flower Corollas are placed at the bottom of the jar to make sure that the perishable produce can last for many days.\\nHowever, there were cases where a vendor had so much faith in this device that they didn't replace the old Mist Flower Corollas in time. By the time when the vendor noticed the anomaly in the container, fermentation had taken place and liquid with a strong smell had been produced. Hearing such news, a few researchers were inspired and came up with a research topic â€” \"The Production of Mixed-Flavor Juice Within Sealed Containers.\"",
