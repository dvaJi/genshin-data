  "description": "An orderly field that is saturated with Sub-Space Creation energy. The clear water has almost unlimited nutrition, and thus seeds thrown in here will grow into exquisite aquatic plants in time without much need for intensive care. However, aquatic plants will tend to put long roots down here, so you cannot put too many of them in here if you wish to give them all sufficient room to grow.\\nThe following seeds, spores, and samples obtained from the Seed Dispensary may be planted here: Horsetail, Snapdragon, Lotus Head, Calla Lily, Seagrass, Sea Ganoderma, Pluie Lotus, Sprayfeather Gill.",
