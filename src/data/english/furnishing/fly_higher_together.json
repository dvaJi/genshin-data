  "description": "A modestly styled double swing made of wood, beloved by children for its inexplicable allure amidst the many attractions of \"Easybreeze Holiday Resort.\"\\nCompared to the resort's other novel amusements, the swing is simple in both design and operation: perch upon its humble plank, give a push from your toes, lift your feet, and you're airborne in a moment of makeshift flight. It may not stir the heart with thrill, but for friends who ride it side by side, to sway together in laughter â€” is that not happiness worth remembering?",
