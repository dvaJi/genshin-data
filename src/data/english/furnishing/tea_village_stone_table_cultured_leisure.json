  "description": "A round stone table of old, elegant make that can be found in Qiaoying Village. Its simple appearance is combined with simple yet finely carved patterns.\\nThey say that green stone is seen in Liyue's courtyard design philosophy as a sign of harmony with nature, while the round table symbolizes composure. That is why many in Chenyu Vale enjoy placing such round tables in their yards to not only facilitate chats around pots of tea but also for the cultivation of one's mind.",
