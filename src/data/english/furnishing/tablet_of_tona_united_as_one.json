  "description": "A complex stone wheel bearing the emblem of the Natlan dragons at its center, identical in design to those enshrined within the Temple of Pax. Said to be connected to the Sacred Flame, the Tablet of Tona symbolizes the unity of the people of Natlan, their dragons, the Sacred Flame, and the Pyro Archon. During offerings, the central circle rotates — a reenactment of the trials and tribulations the tribes endured to collect the Sacred Flame.",
