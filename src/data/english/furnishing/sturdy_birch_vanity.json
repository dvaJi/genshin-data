  "description": "A vanity made from birch. Its low and squat design ensures its stability no matter how many items are mounted on it.\\nIts only flaw is that dust accumulates beneath it, while brooms have trouble reaching in, meaning that it must be removed when the room is being cleaned. In some sense, one might also argue that this vanity's existence led in turn to the iteration and improvement of broomsticks in the market.",
