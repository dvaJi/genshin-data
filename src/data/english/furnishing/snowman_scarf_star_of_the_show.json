  "description": "A unique bib that looks like a ruffled collar. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nSnowmen that wear such bibs often play comedic roles that bring joy to children during their games. However, several continuous days of snowfall might cause the collar to get bent out of shape by the accumulation of too much snow. As such, the children will conduct detailed cleanup for this bib accessory each day.",
