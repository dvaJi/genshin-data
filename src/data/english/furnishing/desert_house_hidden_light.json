  "description": "This building can be found within Aaru Village and has an exceedingly compact design, such that an entire troop of guards can store their equipment here without any issue.\\nIt is said that one of the selection rituals for the Guardians of Aaru Village is that one must \"exceed the very first Guardian's distance on a throw using the heaviest weapon in the warehouse.\" At this time, the guard with two differently-colored eyes was not even eight years old, and when the people crowded around her and the warehouse doors were opened, they discovered that a ridiculously long spear rested against the wall. The wooden floorboards were dented by its sheer weight, and the spear's point was almost poking through the ceiling.\\nWhat? Was this some sort of strength-training tool? A performance prop intended to catch the eyes of onlookers?

Deftly she hurled the spear, and what did they know? It landed just half a pace further than the previous Guardian's record\\nAfter this incident, some obstinate former Guardians never again said a word of doubt against that young girl.
