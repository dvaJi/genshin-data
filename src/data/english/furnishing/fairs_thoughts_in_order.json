  "description": "A large, well-organized standing cabinet that can be found in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. Made from common Natlan stone, it is divided into three different sections. Large in size and simple in layout, it offers exceptionally organized storage when maintained by a dedicated attendant. However, it may be less practical for individuals who lack the time to manage it regularly. Of course, some will intentionally choose this type of cabinet, as the process of thoroughly reorganizing its contents each time can also serve as a mental exercise â€” an opportunity to sort through one's thoughts and memories.",
