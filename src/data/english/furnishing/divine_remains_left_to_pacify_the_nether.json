  "description": "A magnificent, exquisitely crafted Mingxiao Lantern said to be made from materials inspired by the legendary Liyue folk tale, \"The Sanctification of Tao Du.\" It resembles an ancient tree in full bloom, towering up amidst misty mountain peaks. When lit at nighttime, its gentle glow illuminates the land beneath, bestowing blessings on all around.\\nHistorical records state that the divine remains of the god Tao Du, originally known as \"Bo Na,\" lie in rest beneath Mt. Qingce, pacifying the underworld and holding the balance between the realms of the living and the dead.",
