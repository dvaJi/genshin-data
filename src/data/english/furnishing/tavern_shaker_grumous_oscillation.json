  "description": "This drink shaker, as practical as it is exquisite, is a gift from Master Diluc. It is said that this shaker can make drinks of exceptional richness, which can stimulate the truest emotions of those who partake. Thus, the drinks this shaker makes have earned the nickname \"liquor of truth.\" A certain classic tale also circulates between customers and bartenders alike â€” that giving such a gift means that the other party is someone you would drink with any day, thus making it a symbol of \"unreserved trust.\"",
