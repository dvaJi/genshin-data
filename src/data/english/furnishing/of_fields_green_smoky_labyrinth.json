  "description": "A shrub fence corner of the garden known as \"Of Fields Green.\" When combined with the tall Starflower Fences, they can be used to form verdant mazes suitable for guiding guests through different parts of your courtyard and inviting them to linger upon sights that they would otherwise easily miss.\\n\"Of Fields Green\" draws inspiration from wonderlands in fairy tales. Many such stories will guide children towards finding wonderful things that are hidden in plain sight, which they do without care for the effort expended. Walking through such a courtyard may bring such memories of youth to mind...",
