  "description": "An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.\\n\"Mommy, look, that kitty looks like a dirty wee ball of snow!\" This mischievous cat's name did indeed originate from a young child's faux-pas. Gray Snow Cats are very playful creatures, and any time or place can become a war-zone for their frolicking — much to the chagrin of their owners, who must always then give them baths. \\nBut there are no such worries in the Realm Within — the realm is so clean that the cats can play outside and roll around the to their hearts' content without so much as a speck of dirt sticking to them.",
