  "description": "This might look like a tiny pile of stones, but it may just be the protruding tip of one colossal rock, most of which is underground. Having lain in the grass for so long, Liyue locals have taken to calling it the \"Hiding Grazestone.\"\\nThis stone is difficult to dig out of the ground, and in attempting to do so, one is likely to happen across an ancient Boom Blossom in the process. For these reasons, workers would rather build their road around it to avoid having to deal with it.",
