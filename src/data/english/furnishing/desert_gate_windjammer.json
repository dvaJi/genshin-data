  "description": "This courtyard doorway has many of the same aesthetics as Aaru Village's warehouse. It is built primarily with heavy stones, and the interior of the door frame is said to be reinforced by metal supports capable of withstanding a charge from a certain Sumpter Beast cavalry brigade of the Eremites which may or may not exist. The courtyard is, after all, a key weakness to any structure and will be heavily targeted. Should there come a need to retreat deeper inward to the warehouse, villagers can blockade the doorway with stones and other heavy objects.",
