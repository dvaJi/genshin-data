  "description": "A folding screen meticulously crafted from fine brocade, set within a high-quality Sandbearer Wood frame, which exudes a dignified simplicity and refined elegance. Among the many exquisite decorations showcased during the Lantern Rite, this screen stands out as a rare masterpiece.\\nThe brocade surface is adorned with motifs of swallows, butterflies, fortune slips, and sigils. Paired with another similar screen, it forms a scene inspired by the Eight Adepts. A red plum blossom branch graces one corner of the screen, as if narrating the tale of winter night's arrival, of unwavering resilience despite the blurring of the boundary between life and death.",
