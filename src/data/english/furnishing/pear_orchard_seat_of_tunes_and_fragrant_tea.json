  "description": "An orderly arrangement of round tables and stools made from Fragrant Cedar Wood. It is usually set up close to the stage for guests to sip tea while listening to opera. It is said that Yun-Han Opera Troupe has an unspoken rule: the sitting order of guests present is arranged randomly.\\nGuests with a wealthy background are not able to book the front seats, and the common people are also able to get seats that are closest to the stage. Sometimes, guests who came together would end up being seated separately, but they did not complain. After all, when the performer on stage puts on a brilliant performance, the audience would give their undivided attention and naturally will not have time to make small talk with other guests at the same table.",
