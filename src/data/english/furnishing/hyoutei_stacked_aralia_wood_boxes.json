  "description": "Many wooden boxes that have been stacked up and built from heavily painted Aralia Wood. Their ability to retain heat is quite excellent.\\nThe old folks of Hanamizaka claim that these boxes were originally meant to help workers traveling out of doors to store meals. Some workplaces would provide lunch for their workers, and one such box would hold enough food to feed four. Easy to take, put down, and store, these boxes were most convenient indeed. Later on, they would also be used to store snacks and other things.",
