  "description": "An Amur Maple with a lovely form. Its deep red, almost chocolate leaves each seem to resemble the silhouettes of birds.\\nThe Amur Maple was once seen as a marker of the cold seasons, with the deepness of its leaves' colors corresponding to the harshness of the coming winter. However, though Inazuma's climate has since stabilized, the leaves of these maple trees still retain their deep red coloration.",
