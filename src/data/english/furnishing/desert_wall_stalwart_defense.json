  "description": "A short section of wall, like the ones that surround the Aaru Village warehouse. They are very sturdily built and will be a pain to climb or get over.\\nAs the warehouse is a key site within the village that contains a great number of shared supplies. If the village should face an attack that they cannot easily defend against, the village guards will escort everyone to the warehouse grounds, where they will then hold fast until the danger passes. Today, the organization of these defenses has fallen to the Guardian with heterochromatic eyes, and so though the villagers are not lax, they are nonetheless quite at peace.",
