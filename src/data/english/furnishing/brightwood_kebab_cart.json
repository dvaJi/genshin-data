  "description": "This kebab store is composed of a Brightwood pushcart base with an additional ceiling, stove, barbecue rack, and a food display tray added to it for ease of movement and doing business. Only a very small number of chefs and staff are required to keep a store like this running.\\nSome customers absolutely adore the unique experience of eating out in the open, enjoying delicious food made on the spot by chefs on the busy streets. After all, even if you are unable to get a seat at a popular restaurant, you can still have a great time at these kebab stands.",
