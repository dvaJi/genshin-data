The top of the platform is wide enough to accommodate several furnishings.\\nJust a few of these buildings at the edge of the rainforest would suffice to guard against all types of threats from multiple directions. In this leisurely Realm Within, this tall building seems to be the perfect choice for stargazing and the appreciation of natural beauty.",
