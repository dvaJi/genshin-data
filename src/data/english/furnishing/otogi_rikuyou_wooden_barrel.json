  "name": "Otogi \"Rikuyou\" Wooden Barrel",
  "description": "A practical combination of wooden barrels that villagers often place by streams to wash food and clothing. The length of the wooden boards is not consistent, and some say that this was the intention of the ones who made them: to allow washed clothes to be hung along the sides of the barrel to prevent double-work.\\nThough the old folks often say that such barrels have six purposes, hence its name, most villagers can only name five of these uses... Nor is there a consensus as to whether chucking these barrels at the heads of attacking monsters to buy time for one to escape counts as the sixth method of usage or not.",
