  "description": "A kind of street light often seen in Mt. Qingce. A sturdy covering on top protects the lamp from the elements.\\nA legend tells of a yaksha who once disguised themselves as a traveling merchant. They carried their luggage on their back and hung a lantern from each end of the carrying pole. At night, they entered dangerous territory, attracted the attention of some monsters, and promptly tore them to shreds.\\nTo this day, people still believe that the sight of an evil-repelling lantern will scare monsters enough to deter them from drawing near.",
