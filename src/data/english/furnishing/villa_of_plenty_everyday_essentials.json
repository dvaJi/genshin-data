  "description": "A distinctive small dwelling unique to the Collective of Plenty, its exterior is shaped like the massive horns of a Tatankasaurus and built with from sturdy stone. It is said that such horn-shaped buildings are immensely popular in the Collective of Plenty â€” partly because the Tatankasaurus' horn symbolizes strength, a highly esteemed virtue in the tribe, and partly because the design creates a high internal ceiling. This space effectively draws in stale air and heat, making it ideal for installing exhaust vents and smoke ducts.",
