  "description": "A common avian species in Teyvat. Plump and meaty, but can also be trained to deliver messages.\\nAn ordinary pigeon that takes its name from its gray feathers. This pigeon's feathers become gradually greener along the neck, which unfortunately led the normally not-so-observant Paimon into believing that they're the exact same color as Chubby's. In truth, the greater similarity between the two lies in them both serving as punctual messengers.",
