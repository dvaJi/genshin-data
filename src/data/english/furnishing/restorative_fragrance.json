  "description": "An ornate vase with just the right amount of extravagance, decorated with pale white desert flowers.\\nIt is said that the flowers in the vase were not chosen for their beauty, but for their vigorous vitality and ability to grow in places lacking in moisture. Therefore, this vase of flowers is not merely for decorative purposes. They serve as encouragement to the desert dwellers that even in a desperate situation, they should persevere like these flowers and wait for the fruit of their hard work to bloom.",
