  "description": "A shrine in the style of the Grand Narukami Shrine, made using scarlet Yumemiru Wood. It is much taller and more solemn than your average shrine. Just standing next to it, you can feel the errant thoughts in your heart start to fade away.\\nOf course, the weight of a shrine in the peoples' hearts has nothing to do with their size. This type of shrine is far older than the ones that can be seen in Inazuma City today. It is said that the latter type, which is simpler to make, was created as the Shogunate's response to the Raiden Shogun's order to rationalize material usage, but this narrative has never been sanctioned or endorsed by the authorities.",
