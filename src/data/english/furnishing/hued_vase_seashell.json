  "description": "Porcelain jars that are normally seen in Deshret Desert. The main part presents a clear \"seashell color,\" decorated with exquisitely patterned dark gold glaze. \\nThe environment in desert areas is extremely dry and the temperature varies greatly between day and night, so artisans from Aaru Village improved the process of making pottery, using clay found deep in the desert. The pots made this way possess the color of sea shells. This color is also regarded as the purest color of pottery by masons in desert settlements.",
