  "description": "A building found in the Court of Fontaine's Vasari Passage. The famous Café Lutece combines this design with an open air patio, creating a space where customers can enjoy the coffee outside, surrounded by its aroma. It is said that construction costs in Vasari Passage are relatively low due to the use of improved slag cement. Slag cement normally contains trace amounts of a smell reminiscent of powdered ore. While it may go unnoticed by the ordinary person, for those in the catering industry, it is highly detrimental to the long-term storage of goods. Thanks to the strict aromatic standards of a previous owner of Café Lutece, and with the help of The Steambird and protests from many others in the industry throughout the city, researchers dared not ignore the issue and began researching an improved formula that removed the lingering odor. As a result, some coffee enthusiasts have nicknamed the latest generation of slag cement \"Coffee Ground Cement.\"",
