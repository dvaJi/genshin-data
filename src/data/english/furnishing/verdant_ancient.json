  "description": "An exceedingly thick tree with lush leaves that can provide wide-spanning shelter. Its luxurious crown is deep green, and it is said that it has lived for at least a thousand years.\\nIt is a shame that such trees may only be found on Narukami Island â€” the intense warfare in Tatarasuna and Yashiori Island have destroyed a great number of trees, for thick tree crowns are an ideal spot for enemy archers to lie in ambush, which has led to both sides hacking many such trees down in hopes of removing such threats.",
