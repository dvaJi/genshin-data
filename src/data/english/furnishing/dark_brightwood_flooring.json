  "description": "Brightwood flooring with simple shape patterning and faint veins. The faint veins are a product of the timber's drying process and long storage time, while the simple shapes were drawn using the dregs of herbal medicines commonly used in the forest. These floorboards are both moisture and insect-resistant, and emit a faint woody fragrance.",
