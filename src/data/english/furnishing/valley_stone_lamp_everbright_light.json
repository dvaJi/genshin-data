  "description": "A heavy, simple stone lantern that can be found throughout Chenyu Vale. As a stone product, it is relatively costly to produce, but its pagoda-like design is both beautiful and durable. In theory, this stone lantern is highly resistant to damage, being able to withstand wind, rain, and even being attacked by wild beasts. This actually allows stone lanterns to indirectly save a lot on maintenance costs, especially over the long term. For this reason, many areas in Chenyu Vale that require permanent lighting have such stone lamps installed.",
