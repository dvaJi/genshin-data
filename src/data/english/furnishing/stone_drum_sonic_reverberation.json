  "description": "Stone carvings shaped like war drums with exquisite carved patterns that can be found throughout Chenyu Vale.\\nIt is said that these stone carvings originated from the war drums used by the Millelith. Hundreds of years ago, the Millelith would use such drums while doing battle with evil spirits in various places across Liyue. After immigrants from Liyue Harbor had settled in Chenyu Vale for some time, the idea that \"war drums can exorcise evil, guard the home, and deter evil spirits\" spread and took root, and the custom of placing war drums at the entrance to the home for protection became commonplace. Over time, this tradition evolved into the current practice of stone drums being used as guardians.",
