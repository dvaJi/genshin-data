  "description": "A standard \"People of the Springs\" stilt house, with an overall design featuring unique shell-like lines. Compared to traditional buildings, its most notable feature is the suspended floorboards. This design ensures the structure remains stable on soft sandy ground and effectively avoids flood and pest invasions, making it an excellent choice for waterside living.",
