  "description": "Seats with a huge plant leaf providing shade. Originally designed as multilevel seating for guests of the Veluriyam Mirage, they are quite suitable for areas with limited space, allowing everyone to see the stage clearly. However, due to limited practical experience, they aren't the most comfortable of seats, and thus in some areas they have become used for storage or as ladders.",
