  "description": "A dinner plate with complex patterns on it. Such utensils have their usage originating in Liyue, though the glazing process has been modified to match local methods, making it most hardy and durable indeed. The images do look quite complicated, but it in fact requires a lot less work than might first appear on account of the special drawing tools available.\\nThe plate's main colors, being green and dark orange, prevent it from being stained with grease or oil too easily, and people thus use it to hold meat dishes.",
