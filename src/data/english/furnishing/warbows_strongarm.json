  "description": "In Natlan, trees tend not to be named for their appearance, but according to the ways in which their wood is normally used.\\nWhen crafting a high-quality longbow, one must ensure that the wood is both flexible and strong. Only trees with straight and dense grains, moderately hard cores, and of a sufficient age will do the job. Trees of this caliber, however, are exceedingly rare â€” hence why the Speaker's Chamber strictly oversees and regulates their use.",
