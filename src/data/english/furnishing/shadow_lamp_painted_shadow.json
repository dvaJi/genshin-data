  "description": "The Shadow Lamp is a distinctly Liyue-style street light built from Sandbearer wood.\\nThe paper cutting on the lampshade means that pretty patterns can be seen from certain angles when it lights up. Occasionally, lamp makers who enjoy displaying their artistic talents will add extra flourishes to the design on the lampshade.\\nHowever, given the cost of customization and the typical selling price for these lanterns, most items on the market bear simple plant or animal motifs.",
