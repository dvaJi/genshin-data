  "description": "A uniquely shaped dwelling with elegant contours that is commonly found in Merusea Village. To humans, a dwelling of this kind might seem quite claustrophobic, but for the smaller Melusines, this is no issue at all.\\nThey say that some Melusines see their houses as bubbling \"stone crabs,\" though others are not quite as fond of this analogy, since \"crabs don't look very friendly. They always look like they might pinch your Tidalga or something!\"",
