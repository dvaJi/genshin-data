  "description": "A common avian species in Teyvat. Plump and meaty, but also capable of delivering messages.\\nThis pure-white member of the pigeon family is especially friendly towards humans, but is also highly perceptive of humans' ill intent. Interesting trivia: There is a widely held belief in Mondstadt that an authentic Sweet Madame must be cooked using pigeon meat, but this is just a rumor and nothing more. \\nIn the Realm Within, there is no need to send and receive messages, so pigeons are often idle, sometimes delivering things to other animals and going on flights in the morning to maintain their flying ability. Over time, some animals have come to look to the pigeons' flights as a marker of time. Unfortunately for them, the pigeons themselves sometimes don't have a good sense of time.",
