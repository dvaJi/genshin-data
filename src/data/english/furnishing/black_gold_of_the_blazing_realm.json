  "description": "A simple weapon rack crafted from Peach Palm Wood, featuring wave-shaped railings designed for long-term weapon storage. These racks can be seen all across Natlan.\\nNatlanese weapons often have obsidian blades, a material renowned for its unparalleled sharpness and self-honing properties, allowing them to stay razor-sharp even after extended use. However, it is extremely brittle and therefore prone to chipping, so such weapons must be kept hung up in storage. Consequently, weapon racks in Natlan are typically designed for vertical arrangement, ensuring both easy access and protection against ground impacts that could damage the delicate blade edges.",
