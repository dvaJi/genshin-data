  "description": "The literati of Liyue are always capable of finding the fun in life, and will always endeavor to coin charming names for all manner of things in the world around them.\\nSadly, this poor stone proved simply too ordinary even for them. After scouring the pages of every known ancient text and reviewing every rumor, legend, and folktale they could find, not a single story was identified that made any kind of reference to this stone. Hence, for lack of a historical homage to draw on for inspiration, they named it the \"Unprecedentedly Average Stone.\"",
