  "description": "A chandelier that combines the aesthetics of Inazuma as well as other nations. An octagonal design with a flat top and bottom have been utilized here, giving it a rather novel appearance as compared to your traditional Inazuman lanterns. In the words of a certain housekeeper, this sort of light can be mounted on a flat table to dismantle and clean with ease, and its lighting capabilities are a fair sight better than standard Inazuman lanterns, which makes it very useful indeed.",
