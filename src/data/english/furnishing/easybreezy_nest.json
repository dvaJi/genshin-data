  "description": "A charming oval-shaped gazebo constructed of White Chestnut Oak Wood and metal components, topped with dragon-nest ornaments, scattered throughout the \"Easybreeze Holiday Resort.\" Allegedly the creation of a foreign architect, it was designed to serve as a shared resting space for both Asha and humans. The architect mistakenly understood \"Asha\" to be a dragon's nickname and thus infused the design with draconic elements. The result? A structure beloved by Asha and tourists alike, now a permanent icon of the resort.",
