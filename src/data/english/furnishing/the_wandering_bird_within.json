  "description": "A lush Amur Maple crowned with brownish-red leaves, and whose extended branches and leaves very much resemble the migratory wild geese that come flying here from the lands of harsh winter.\\nThough the Amur Maple is a native species to Liyue that was brought to Inazuma, these trees have taken on unique characteristics due to the soil and water of their new home, as has a unique culture grown up around them. The golden-red maple leaves of Liyue represent the harvest and wealth, and are considered to be auspicious signs. In Inazuma, however, the maple leaves are a melancholy reminder of summer's passing and winter's arrival, and they have become symbols of sorrow often found in poems that tell of old friends missed.",
