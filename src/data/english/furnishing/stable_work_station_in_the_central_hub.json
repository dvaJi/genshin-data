  "description": "This large office desk may be found in the Duke's office in the Fortress of Meropide. Crafted from sturdy Linden Wood, it features a curved desktop designed with careful consideration for ergonomics, significantly enhancing the user's work efficiency.\\nThere are rumors that claim that the designer, taking practical use into account, intentionally added a metal \"bulletproof layer\" to this type of office desk to ensure the client's safety. However, since no one in the Fortress dares to challenge the Duke's authority, it seems that this desk may never have the opportunity to prove its defensive capabilities.",
