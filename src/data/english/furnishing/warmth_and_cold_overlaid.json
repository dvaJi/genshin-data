  "description": "A rug that can be found in the desert regions. Though it looks very thick, it is in fact very light and comfortable, and will not tire its wearer even when thrown around the shoulders for long periods of time.\\nIt is said that the wheat-colored variety are often used to keep wearers warm as they sleep, and can be used to ward off the desert cold. The red version, on the other hand, is used when going out in the day, being excellent at deflecting both the heat and the sun's glare. It is even said that the red ones can cause beasts to avoid you on account of mistaking you for an Eremite.",
