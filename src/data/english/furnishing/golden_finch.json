  "description": "A chirpy little bird, found in nooks and crannies all over Teyvat.\\nThis fluffy, golden finch looks stunning in the sunlight. Some children like to catch Golden Finches and take them home as pets, but they struggle to adapt to the rowdy living environments of human beings. Consequently, they tend to find an opportunity to fly back off into the wild before long. The peaceful and relaxing atmosphere in The Realm Within suits their living habits very well.",
