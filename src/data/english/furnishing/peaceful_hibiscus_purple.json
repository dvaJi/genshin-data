  "description": "A cluster of flowers dipped in a blue-lilac shade. In its presence, it feels as if the atmosphere around it has also become peaceful and relaxed. Even if you travel all across Sumeru, you would find it difficult to locate their habitat. Only in the Realm Within, where all living things grow unrestricted, can you get slightly closer to restoring their true appearance.",
