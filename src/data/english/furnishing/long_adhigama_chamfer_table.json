  "description": "A long table cut from just the right thickness of Adhigama Wood is at once a sight for the eyes and also requires little time to create. Its edges are specially designed and sliced. It's claimed that this is due to it being constructed to accommodate the Forest Rangers making their arrangements in narrow rooms. Having these tables reduces occurrences of unfortunate incidents... such as someone banging their shin hard against the table's edge.",
