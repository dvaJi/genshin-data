  "description": "A low table constructed from a Flammabomb Wood frame and Ashen Aratiku Wood boards. Though unremarkable as tables go, they are cheap and simple to manufacture, making them the go-to choice among merchants in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame seeking temporary display shelves. Apparently, some shopkeepers will even choose these tables over other options, for the simple reason that their plain design better sets off the splendor of more ornate merchandise.",
