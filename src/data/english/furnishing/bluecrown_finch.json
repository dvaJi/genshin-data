  "description": "The Bluecrown Finch is a small songbird with a beautiful voice that's commonly found in Fontaine.\\nThey are said to be very sensitive to the world around them, and they immediately abandon their nests and take to the skies if they detect the slightest movement in the surroundings. Therefore, the cowardly Bluecrown Finch often symbolizes an omen of disaster in folklore. As new arrivals in the Realm Within, they often mistook the movements of their neighbors from other countries as an ominous omen and sought Tubby's protection. But over time, these birds have gradually become accustomed to a peaceful life, and so their talents are now utilized as Tubby's troublemaker detection system, achieving remarkable results in the process.",
