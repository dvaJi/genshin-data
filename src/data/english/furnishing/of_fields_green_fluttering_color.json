  "description": "Ornamental flowers from the garden known as \"Of Fields Green.\" Their blooms are full, their colors striking, and but a light touch will cause loose petals to drift and scatter.\\n\"Of Fields Green\" draws inspiration from wonderlands in fairy tales. In these tales, these flowers that scatter their petals and pollen at the slightest touch bring good fortune to children. However, forcibly plucking flowers that have yet to bloom is a punishable offense here in Wonderland.",
