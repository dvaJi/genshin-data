  "description": "A flower pot from the House of Daena with a humble-looking luminescent plant inside. Its appearance is not exactly attractive, and it doesn't give off nice scents or possess any medicinal properties. To people passing by, it may be easy to ignore and seem at odds with the solemn atmosphere in the House of Daena.\\nHowever, it is said that the scholar who proposed the installation of these plants specifically selected them because of how common they looked. According to that scholar, these plants can serve as a reminder to all students that despite the plants' ordinary appearance, they still had a place in the halls of the House of Daena, and the same applies to the students â€” as such, there is no need to dwell too much on their ancestry or wealth. The most important thing is that everyone is here to immerse themselves in academic study.",
