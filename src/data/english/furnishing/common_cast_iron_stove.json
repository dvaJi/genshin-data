  "description": "An Inazuman metal stove made using traditional techniques. Its design is quite compact and can be moved about quite easily. It is very commonly used, and it is claimed that it can heat a wok about twice the diameter of the stove mouth with great efficacy.\\nInazuma once had a period in which \"raw foods\" were all the rage, and while some fish did indeed have very delicious meat and eating raw food does provide some fine variety, one eats like this long-term at the risk of catching certain diseases. Such raw food would, in turn, depart from the central core of Inazuman gourmet when these inexpensive and easy-to-use stoves came into vogue.",
