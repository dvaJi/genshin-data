  "description": "A two-stringed instrument that bears many of Sumeru's unique characteristics. Built with a long neck and strong strings, this instrument is based on an ancient Sumeru stringed instrument, thus imbuing it with the weight of tradition and history. In Teyvat, where music is ever-evolving in terms of both instruments and composition, design and style must also advance with the times and undergo iterating improvements. In the present day, this instrument can be played with either one's fingers or bowstrings.\\nSome players in Sumeru habitually equip this light, blue-framed instrument with twin strings made of silk and gel, giving it a crystalline timber. This allows it to play the brighter and crisper notes in an ensemble.",
