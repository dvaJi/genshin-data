  "description": "A flower-shaped machine component assembled from assorted materials. It enhances no attribute, nor possesses any function. A flower-shaped machine component is simply that â€” neither grand nor trivial.\\nHumankind immortalizes cherished memories through crafted objects, and conveys unspoken gratitude through the giving of gifts.
