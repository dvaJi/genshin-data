  "description": "This stone gateway is round like the full moon, and similar designs are seen in some courtyards in Chenyu Vale.\\nIt is said that the artisans of Liyue like to use the technique of borrowing scenery and allowing it to leak through to create an artistic conception of the beauty of a secluded, winding path. Skilled artisans will use such a full moon door as a canvas for a fan painting, using it to create a painted landscape that changes with every step. Therefore, should you be fortunate enough to pass by such a door in such a courtyard, consider slowing your steps while passing by.",
