  "description": "It is believed that many years ago, a rapid-flowing river ran through the mountains, posing an obstacle to the pioneers who first set foot there. People took stones and placed them in the water so that they could traverse the river. Since then, flat-topped stones have been referred to as \"Stepping Stones.\"",
