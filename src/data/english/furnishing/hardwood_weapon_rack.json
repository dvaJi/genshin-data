  "description": "A classic style of weapon rack that is widely used by the Millelith today.\\nThough it has a simple design, it is both stable and durable and can be produced in large quantities. Imitations of this design can be widely found across the seven nations.\\nHowever, the hardwood used by the Millelith for these shelves has a sophisticated milling technique and is produced exclusively in Liyue Harbor, making the imitations found elsewhere greatly inferior.",
