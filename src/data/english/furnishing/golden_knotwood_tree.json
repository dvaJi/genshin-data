  "description": "Save for a few rare and precious tree types, the people of Liyue are accustomed to using broad-reaching collective terms for trees and aren't so fussy about the exact species of tree included. For example, trees with curved trunks are referred to by the more sophisticated-sounding term \"Knotwood.\"\\nThe Golden Knotwood Tree has a spectacular color and for this reason adorns many an estate.",
