  "description": "\"If you remove the thick outer skins of unripe desert plants, you can obtain rather bitter fruits that can be used against particularly recalcitrant or ill-behaved criminals.\"\\nThe latest edition of the matra operating manual contains this particular note concerning this kind of desert shrub.\\nThese plants are not poisonous while unripe, but they will leave a bizarre bitter taste in one's mouth for days on end even after only one bite, which can lead to much mental distress. Matra who have tried these fruits out of curiosity unanimously agree that they would be very suitable tools for forcing criminals to reveal the truth.",
