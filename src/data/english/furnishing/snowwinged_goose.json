  "description": "The Snow-Winged Goose is a large waterfowl that lives in ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water. They enjoy great popularity due to their noble and gorgeous appearance.\\nTheir snow-white wings and loyalty to their families make them the perfect symbol of purity and nobility for poets.\\nAfter arriving in the Serenitea Pot, the Snow-Winged Goose's habits have remained unchanged. Though some animals do not recognize these birds, there is always a sense of peace and elegance suffusing the air nearby, which makes the other animals instinctively want to avoid disturbing them.",
