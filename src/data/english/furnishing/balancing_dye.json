  "description": "Bright orange blooms occasionally found in the Sumeru wilderness, and also bred in the Pardis Dhyai laboratories. Apart from being an ornamental species, a special dye can be extracted from the petals to add color to luminescent extracts. Indoor light sources usually prefer warm shades; however, luminescent extracts with large yields are often pure white or blueish purple in color, necessitating the utilization of this plant to balance out their natural hue.",
