  "description": "Bright orange blooms occasionally found in the Sumeru wilderness, and also bred in the Pardis Dhyai laboratories. Apart from being an ornamental species, a special dye can be extracted from the petals to add color to luminescent extracts. Indoor light sources usually prefer warm shades. However, luminescent extracts with large yields are often pure white or blueish purple in color, necessitating the utilization of this plant to balance out their natural hue.",
