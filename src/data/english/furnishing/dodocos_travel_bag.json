  "description": "\"Mom told me loooots of tales of adventure.\"\\n\"You might meet some bad guys during your adventures, so you need to stack lots of Jumpy Dumpties and Sparks 'n' Splashes with you!\"\\n\"But if you put too many things into your bag, it'll get way too heavy... Hmm, if only bags could walk by themselves.\"\\n\"So Mom said that we could mount a Jumpy Dumpty bouncing pad beneath the bag.\"\\n\"So all we'd need to do is to throw the bag, and it'll go bouncing away!\"\\n...\\nHaving heard this from Klee, Barbara once took the bag out of curiosity, lifted it up, and hurled it forwards.\\nAnd it actually worked, more or less, as intended!\\nUnfortunately, this luggage would become very heavy indeed when filled with things. If allowed to bounce all around Mondstadt City, it might just bust its way through tavern walls, flip dining tables, all the while being very hard for the Knights to stop. So perhaps it is best left to rest in a room and used as a decoration.",
