  "description": "A piece of equipment that looks exactly the same as the \"Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine\" and is capable of producing Fonta: Classic anytime, anywhere. However, when used in the Realm Within, it doesn't seem to require any purchases with Mora or Credit Coupons...\\nAfter hearing Paimon's account of your adventures in the Fortress of Meropide and trying a small sample, Tubby happily copied this machine.
