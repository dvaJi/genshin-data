  "name": "Music Town's Hut: \"Mardouce Harmony\"",
  "description": "A hand-crafted hut carefully designed by artisans, the roof features red and blue intertwined. \"Both colors are great, so I want them all.\" Such was the decision made by a resident of Petrichor when purchasing machine-dyed awnings in the Court of Fontaine. This decision paved the way for this hut, which has the beauty of both \"Marcotte Red\" and \"Lumidouce Blue\" at the same time. However, since making this hut requires a lot of labor, selling it in any other market is a nigh-impossibility. Thus, the residents of the Court of Fontaine have yet to enjoy this beautiful solution.",
