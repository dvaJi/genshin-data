  "description": "A large pond for rearing fish.\\nThe orange molten lava in the pool was specially crafted by Tubby using the power of Sub-Space Creation in The Realm Within, creating an environment that mimics the natural habitat of certain ornamental fish from Natlan. In this molten lava, the fish live a contented life similar to their original environment. Thanks to Tubby's meticulous control, the pool poses no danger to ordinary creatures, so there's no need to worry about getting burned while admiring the fish.\\nOrnamental Fish caught via Fishing can be raised in this sort of pond.",
