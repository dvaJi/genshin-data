  "description": "An ancient and elegant building designed after the style of the Grand Narukami Shrine. Those who come to draw fortune slips often come to subconsciously memorize the layout and even every detail of this building. A certain ancient text published by Yae Publishing House claims that this is the result of the resonance of their spirit with some other \"soul\" that resides within the shrine when they come to divine their fortunes. However, such claims are highly exaggerated â€” it's more likely that the sharp, cold gazes of a certain shrine maiden caused many to fear meeting her gaze, thus memorizing the building's layout in their eagerness to avert their eyes.",
