  "description": "An exquisitely crafted ceramic jar with considerable capacity and a distinctive design reflective of the Masters of the Night-Wind. Whether used for storage or fermentation, it is highly functional. The jar's unique painted design and its lid, shaped like a Iktomisaurus, are said to possess the power to ward off evil and bring peace. However, aside from its aesthetic appeal, it is no different from an ordinary jar, with its supposed protective powers likely being psychological rather than supernatural.",
