  "description": "A booth that can be seen at the Magnificent Irodori Festival. It consists of a Yumemiru Wood table and crates, and doesn't take up much space, but is extremely popular because the main exhibits at this booth are various kinds of fan fiction. The items are often sold out within a few hours, which is a testament to their popularity.

Some loyal readers also believe that by waiting by such booths, it is possible to meet the authors themselves by chance. Of course, such behavior may cause on-site congestion and increase security risks, so it will be politely discouraged by the staff of the festival...",
