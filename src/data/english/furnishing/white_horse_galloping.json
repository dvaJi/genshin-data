  "description": "A giant Xiao Lantern created in the likeness of a certain Adeptus who watches over the moon. It depicts a pale white horse leaping from a cliff face through wisps of clouds, against a background of brilliant sunset hues. Today, people inscribe their wishes on the lantern, perhaps in the hope that the White Horse Adeptus will descend from the moon on a jade chariot to grant their wishes.",
