  "description": "A lovely, exquisitely crafted model Flower Carriage. It is a to-scale reproduction of the Flower Carriage from a certain iteration of the Sabzeruz Festival. Word has it that this carriage is the crystallization of many peoples' wisdom and effort, and was decorated by none other than the Knight of Flowers — in other words, by you.\\nGo forth, then.
