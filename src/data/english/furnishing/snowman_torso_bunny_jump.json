  "description": "A snowman torso with a unique pose that can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nThis sort of snowman feels like it is currently gathering up the energy to jump up high, hence the nickname given to it by the children. That said, snowmen are not very sturdy, and if they were really to jump around like rabbits, they would probably end up losing a lot of body parts.",
