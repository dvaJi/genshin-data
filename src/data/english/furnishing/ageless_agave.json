  "description": "Large plant pots found throughout Natlan that house a rosette-shaped herb. The sharp edges of its fleshy, gray-green leaves are an unusual pink color, making them resemble a Saurian tongue. Renowned for their exceptionally long lifespans, these plants can thrive for decades. Compared to other herbs, they seem to endure a hundred generations â€” hence their hyperbolic moniker, \"Ageless Agave.\"\\nJust as resilience is one of the warrior's greatest virtues, so do these plants embody a profound meaning that goes beyond mere decorative value: a person need not envy the fleeting success of others, but should instead focus on rooting themselves and honing their strength.",
