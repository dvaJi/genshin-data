  "description": "A simple yet easily maintained low railing found throughout the Collective of Plenty, composed of common stone materials and flexible rope. This unique combination of stone pillars and soft ropes not only provides a cushioning effect but also offers a certain level of elasticity, minimizing the risk of injury should a person or saurian accidentally fall in rugged terrain. It is said that the wooden side ropes used in the Grand Wrestling Grounds are manufactured on the same principle.",
