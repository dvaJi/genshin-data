  "description": "A towering and impressive wooden windmill, typically used to measure wind speed and direction, is one of the iconic structures of the Scions of the Canopy.\\nIt is said that, contrary to the stereotypical image of recklessness, the Scions of the Canopy actually place great emphasis on safety and rationality in their passion for extreme sports. They understand that only by challenging oneself under optimal conditions can one break through personal limits. Their windmills, continuously monitoring weather conditions in the heart of the tribe, serve as \"signposts\" to help find the opportune moment.",
