  "description": "Save for a few rare and precious tree types, the people of Liyue are accustomed to using broad-reaching collective terms for trees and aren't so fussy about the exact species of tree included. For example, trees with straight trunks are referred to by the more sophisticated-sounding term \"Irontrunk.\"\\nSome very patient and highly meticulous individuals can craft paper from the wood of the Golden Irontrunk Tree. This type of paper is said to be both tough and flexible. There's no better choice for making a paper fan.",
