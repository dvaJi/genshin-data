  "description": "After Paimon and Tubby discussed your experiences in Chenyu Vale, the latter combined the descriptions she heard with her own imagination to create the green stones that form this marvelously patterned platform.\\nThese green stones, regular and delicate in appearance, and the exquisitely crafted pillar, make it a unique part of the scenery. The green stones have yet to be polished, so they still have some jagged edges that make caution well-advised for those who climb or play on them.",
