  "description": "A store-side display that features a double shelf stuffed with bottled jams of titillating shades. This is a gift from Kaeya.\\n\"If our customers think that our sweet treats aren't quite sweet enough, they can just use these jams to adjust the flavor to their liking.\"\\n\"Paimon originally intended to feast on the jam under the pretext of 'ascertaining their flavor.' But when she heard that leftover ingredients will be reused and can be converted to charity sale income, she actually managed to hold herself back!\"",
