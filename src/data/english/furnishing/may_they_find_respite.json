  "description": "A relatively common type of rock in the mountains of Natlan. Their dry, flat surfaces are said to have been shaped by years of exposure to wind and sun. According to the couriers, large rocks like these are generally quite stable, with fewer gaps beneath for dangerous creatures to lurk within, making them ideal for brief rests during arduous journeys.",
