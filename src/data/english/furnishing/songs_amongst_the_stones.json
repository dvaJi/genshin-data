  "description": "\"Rose, oh rose, grant me my wish.\"\\n\"Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me.\"\\n\"She sang:\"\\n\"No land but folk songs bore my spirit.\"\\n\"Songs shall defy my fate, and overcome my destiny.\"\\n\"They will surpass me, surpass time. They will surpass the ever-lasting withering of life.\"\\n...\\nThe flower that slumbered within the sprout managed to awaken, and the old man who \"planted stones\" has now fulfilled the wish of his predecessor. And this ballad, like the miraculous color of the Golden Rose, will surely remain in the world as a unique \"mark\" upon it.",
