  "description": "The stone likeness of the great and ancient bake-danuki Giichiro.\\nAccording to bake-danuki stories, the whimsical Giichiro could transform himself into a mirage with a radius of over 50 kilometers from his body, sufficient to turn Kannazuka into a giant concert.\\nOf course, this is just an ordinary statue and is not the sealed form of any bake-danuki. After all, Giichiro precedes Ioroi's sealing by Kamuna, Ioroi's following Tsukumo's famous trail, and even the days of Tsukumo himself...\\nOf course, these are just bake-danuki tales, so it is likely that the ratio of truth to exaggeration is similar to that of a drop to an entire ocean.",
