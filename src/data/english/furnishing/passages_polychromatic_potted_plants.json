  "description": "The Vasari Passage is adorned with an array of potted plants, each displaying elegant and bright-colored flowers. Careful consideration is given to selecting plants with light yet elegant fragrances, ensuring they complement the existing scents of the environment rather than overpowering them. These plants serve primarily as decorations, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the surroundings. In addition to the potted displays, the flowers are also planted among roadside bushes, serving as model examples of the \"Court of Fontaine Standards for Urban Decorative Plants.\"",
