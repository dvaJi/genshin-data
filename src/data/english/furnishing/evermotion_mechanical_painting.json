This \"dreamer\" sought to use this artwork to show off the abilities of his marvelous invention, the Kinesis Core.\\nThe Evermotion Mechanical Painting is made from many interlocking parts. If you so much as initiate a small amount of movement, this painting can remain in automatic motion for a long period of time, allowing you to safely leave it unattended for a time.\\nIf this were to be sold in the market, it would surely be quite the popular product.",
