  "description": "A glowing ornamental sphere with donated juvenile Violetglow Jellyfish floating within. These small, non-venomous jellyfish gather in the water and emit a gentle glow, creating a captivating sight and making them highly esteemed among terrarium and aquarium hobbyists in the Court of Fontaine. It is said that these jellyfish bring good luck to the household when displayed in bedrooms or studies. However, neglecting or mistreating them invites great misfortune, as it is seen as a betrayal of the goodwill of these little jellyfish. But Paimon and you are well aware that this rumor probably stems from... a peculiar story about someone carelessly releasing them into the wild.",
