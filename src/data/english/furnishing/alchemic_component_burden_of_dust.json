  "description": "This particular alchemical device is built around a set of scales meant to weigh ingredients. They say that it can weigh dust, but that the hands of an amateur are not to be counted on for such a task.\\nEven a professional can sometimes err, and records exist of just such an error â€” a certain green-haired alchemist once used this device incorrectly and created some unknown powder that caused wild and unending laughter. Not daring to seek out their teacher for aid, this person was forced to heal themselves.\\nRumor has it that Deaconess Barbara's idol activities had to cease for three days afterward.",
