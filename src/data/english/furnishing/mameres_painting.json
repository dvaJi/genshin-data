  "description": "A portrait Mamere painted for Paimon and you. At first glance, it doesn't look much like you and Paimon, or anything with a tangible form for that matter. Instead, it looks like waves of beautiful overlapping colors. But when calmly appreciating the portrait, you find that Mamere is conveying everything she wishes to express to you, layer by layer.\\nAccording to Seymour's evaluation, Mamere can create unique paintings that differ from the \"103,900 different styles of art.\" This makes her paintings priceless treasures, and those who gaze upon her paintings are always able to feel something different from Mamere's art each time they look at it.",
