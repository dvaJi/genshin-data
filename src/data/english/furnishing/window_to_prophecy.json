  "description": "A grand and stylish gate, upon which is carved patterns most intricate. It has the same design as the great metal gate in the Astral Garden.\\nIt is said that every new resident of Simulanka will travel to the Forest of Blessings to give thanks to the Goddess of Creation for casting them, and to Constellation Metropole to pray to the Goddess of Prophecy for an oracle. This great gate happens to be behind the statue of the Goddess of Prophecy, and for this reason, it is no mere great gilded gate. Rather, it is a manifestation of the grace of said Goddess, and thus is reverently called the Window to Prophecy.",
