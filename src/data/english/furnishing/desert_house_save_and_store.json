  "description": "This building can be found in Aaru Village, and has a thick hay roof and a wide, two-story space within, such that both people and many goods can dwell within. Whenever supplies are relatively abundant, the merchants who live in such residences may sometimes directly open their homes — and thereby their shops — and engage in barter trade with their neighbors.\\nOnce, there was a mischievous child who took advantage of just such a time to steal into the second floor of such a shop to find the mysterious treasure of the merchants, only to trip over some of the many goods stored there and sprain their ankle. There that child lay, crying till his throat was hoarse, and yet no one found him. Or rather, no one would have, if not for the keen senses Guardian with the mismatched eyes, who managed to find the lost child by daybreak, just in the nick of time. Though his family scolded him harshly, the Guardian patiently explained what the merchants were storing in their homes. The latter method of teaching worked much better, for now that the child's curiosity was sated, his more outrageous fantasies disappeared, and no other children would make this mistake from then on, or trouble the other villagers in such a manner.",
