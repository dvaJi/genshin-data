  "description": "\"Eh, since I can't sleep, I might as well continue drawing my star map...\"\\nTo avoid the obstruction of dense leaves and branches and gain a clear and broad field of view with which to conduct observations, students who study the stars often organize expeditions to the border between the desert and the rainforest, walking along the Wall of Samiel as they look for research material, so much so that it has practically become a regular study trip of sorts.\\nAs for the young woman suffering from a chronic lack of sleep, she found it hard to sleep in a quiet room, never mind a tent outdoors.\\nBut such observations could also give rise to unexpected surprises. For example, she discovered a special plant after persisting in her star map drawings for one night, finding that its pale white leaves had a unique shape that just so happened to be similar to the distribution of certain stars in the sky. It seemed that her drawing this time had an element of serendipity to it.",
