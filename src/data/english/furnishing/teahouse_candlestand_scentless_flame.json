  "name": "Teahouse Candlestand: Scentless Flame",
  "description": "A candlestand of superlative craft that imitates the ones used in Komore Teahouse. The candles used with these are made from a mix of Naganohara Fireworks' by-products and a small amount of plant leaf extract, such that it does not have any smell when it burns, thus preventing it from affecting guests' enjoyment of their tea. In truth, these candles are even cheaper than the fish tallow candles often used in shrines and are currently being further promoted to the public.",
