  "name": "Market Statue: Vibrant Vacation",
  "description": "A charming and well-crafted statue featuring a delightful design, topped with seven vivid color palettes. Its form mirrors the towering \"Seven-Colored Statue\" that stands along the main avenue of Easybreeze Market. Though its precise origin is now lost to time, it is said the hues represent the colors of sunlight. Perhaps it is under this vibrant light that Tenochtzitoc finds protection, and the dream of \"Easybreeze Holiday Resort\" is spun.",
