  "description": "A display model based on clockwork meka and Pneumousia installations that can be found in the Fortress of Meropide. Only the appearance is the same as the original, as it possesses none of the original's most basic functionality. In theory, programming a clockwork meka to patrol a specific area and equipping it with the intelligence to maintain law and order requires regular maintenance from an engineering specialist, and that doesn't come cheap. As a purely ornamental decoration, it requires none of the high capital costs or difficulties of maintaining an operational device. Preserving only the outward appearance and majesty of the original is certainly a valid option.",
