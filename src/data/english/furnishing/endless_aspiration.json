  "description": "A wooden sign standing within the Flower-Feather Clan, painted with vibrant and dynamic graffiti, exuding a sense of life and movement. It seems to tell of an unending yearning for the skies. Such graffiti, full of symbolism, seems quite fitting for promoting activities like \"Floating Target Balloons,\" which help people experience the thrill of flight.",
