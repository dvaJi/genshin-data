  "description": "A lacquerware statue first released for sale at the Magnificent Irodori Festival. It is based on Inazuma's most distinguished Almighty Shogun, and is designed by Yae Publishing House's top artist and handcrafted by the most skilled lacquerware master in Inazuma City, with excellent workmanship. When one considers this in addition to the mere 300 available at first launch, and the limit on purchases to one per customer, it seems little surprise that there would be a mad rush to purchase one. This one in particular was a gift from General Kujou Sara herself, so it is of particular importance and should be treasured dearly.",
