  "description": "The standard door of the Illusory Annex is made of Mallow Wood that has undergone special processing to make it lightweight yet resilient. Its soundproofing is not inferior to heavy metal sheets. The door is adorned with intricately designed stained glass windows, utilizing ambient light to give the door a simple yet substantial texture that doesn't feel out of place. If handled properly, pushing the door open won't require too much effort.\\nHowever, if neglected, it will soon make itself heard:\\n\"Creak! Creak! Goodness gracious! Haven't you noticed that I'm thirsty? Creak! Creak!\"",
