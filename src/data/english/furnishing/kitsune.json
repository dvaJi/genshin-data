  "description": "A sly, prideful creature that has incredible intelligence and a long-lasting memory â€” or so the urban legends say.\\nThey pay no attention when someone approaches, seemingly used to living alongside mankind.\\nThe kitsune have a long history in Inazuman culture. Some legends say that they were family to the Kitsune Saiguu in ages past. After she disappeared, their kind slowly dwindled, and the Kitsune lost their mystical might, and now no longer speak. \\nThe kitsune seem to have an inexplicable familiarity with the Realm Within, sometimes sitting peacefully in the distance, watching Tubby as she reposes.",
