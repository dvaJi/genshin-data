  "description": "A carving purchased from Acara Crafts that happens to look like someone you know quite well. Her friendliness and kindliness really fit well on an Aranara's form, lifting the spirits of those who look upon the figure with an inner warmth.\\nAfter their initial success, Acara Crafts has been making constant improvements to their art of creating Aranara Carvings, experimenting with various colors and design combinations â€” all part of some happy coincidence, perhaps.\\nTo that friend of yours who came to Port Ormos on her trip, this carving encapsulates the precious memory of your journey together, and the fun you had while traveling across Sumeru. Paimon has thought this aloud at least once after you obtained this unique carving: \"Maybe we'll really see this Aranara in our dreams if we place this carving by the bedside!\"",
