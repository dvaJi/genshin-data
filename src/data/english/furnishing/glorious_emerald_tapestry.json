  "description": "Quality carpets colored with an expensive emerald dye and laced with gold commonly used in Sumeru's buildings, depicting magnificent patterns. The fabric used in the carpet is also unmatched, supple, and tough, known to still look brand new even after one hundred years of use.\\nIt is said that the design of the carpet came from a set of patterns written down by a researcher while solving a puzzle. With some adjustments, you can create designs with wonderful symmetries. That researcher, now a Scribe at the Akademiya, has declined to comment on the story, but this anecdote has been told many times over by merchants to emphasize the magnificence of the carpets' patterns.",
