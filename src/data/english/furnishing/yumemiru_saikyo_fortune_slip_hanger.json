  "description": "The Fortune Slip Hanger that is next to a Fortune Slip-drawing facility.\\nIf your drawn fortune proves inauspicious, you may tie that offending fortune slip to this hanger to absolve yourself of that ill luck. Strangely, the hanger is never filled to capacity, though no one has ever seen the shrine maidens take the ominous slips down from it. This has led to a legend that says that the shrine maidens will pray to dispel the portents of misfortune during the night. Once done, these ill-fated slips will turn into sakura petals, carrying the ill fortunes off with them in the wind.",
