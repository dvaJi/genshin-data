  "description": "A standard single-story wooden standalone structure of the \"Scions of the Canopy,\" typically used for single or double occupancy. It is said that, due to the one-on-one partnership between the \"Scions of the Canopy's\" warriors and the Yumkasaurs, people minimize internal partitions and maximize ceiling height when constructing houses to provide ample space for their Yumkasaurus partners to leap and play. Therefore, even in these space-efficient homes, residents would not choose to add attic lofts to expand the usable area.",
