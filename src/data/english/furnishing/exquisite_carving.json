  "description": "An intricately carved ice sculpture that recreates the elegance of the Snow-Winged Goose, praised as being \"the leader of the flock\" in the field of plating. Apparently, this was made by a certain Technical Head Chef while practicing her knifework.\\nIt is worth mentioning that the material used in the carving is just ordinary ice, but it has been transformed by pure skill. Perhaps it is the same with the formation of a flock and its lead goose — no natural genius, perhaps, but rather an ordinary individual who has honed themselves through endless days of perseverance.",
