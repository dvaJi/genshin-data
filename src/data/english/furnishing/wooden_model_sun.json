  "description": "A decorative wooden tray brimming with candles, flowers, and fruits, modeled after the traditional offering known as the \"Sun\" from Tenochtzitoc.\\nAccording to custom, the people of Tenochtzitoc light the \"Sun\" in reverence, presenting their offerings to the gods and whispering their prayers. As incense curls skyward, it is said their wishes ascend with it, reaching divine ears.\\nOf course, within The Realm Within, no divine intervention is required â€” merely bring your \"offering\" to Tubby. But do take care to choose only the finest harvests, for if the offering falls short, \"Lady Teapot Spirit\" may well take offense.",
