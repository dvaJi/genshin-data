  "description": "A variety of wine bottles and jugs have been stored here in commonly-found containers.\\nLiyue is a place where merchants flock and their wine shops often sell products from other nations. That said, regular patrons know how to find their usual drink without having to inspect the labels.\\nThe drinkers of Liyue often boast of being able to \"drink a hundred cups\" to their friends in other nations. But in truth, Liyue alcohol is best appreciated in small, handleless, and intricately-made cups — the ability to drink a hundred of those is not too preposterous a thing.",
