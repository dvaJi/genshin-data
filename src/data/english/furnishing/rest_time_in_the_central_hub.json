  "description": "This rectangular coffee table, found in the Fortress of Meropide, is crafted from exceptionally high-quality Linden Wood. The tabletop is spacious and smooth, providing ample room for arranging tea sets and snacks, making it an excellent choice for relaxing tea breaks. For those accustomed to working at such desks, the head nurse offers a crucial piece of advice â€” \"The height of your coffee table is not suitable for reading or office work. If you need to work, please use a conventional office desk instead.\"",
