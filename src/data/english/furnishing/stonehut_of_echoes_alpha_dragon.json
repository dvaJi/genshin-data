  "name": "Stonehut of Echoes: Alpha Dragon",
  "description": "A large residence with an open-air balcony, resembling the architectural style used by the chief of the \"Children of Echoes.\" The most striking feature of this building is its exterior, which resembles the head of a dragon with its jaws agape. This design creates a spacious terrace, suitable not only for meetings but also for providing ample space for the Tepetlisaurus to settle. The trade-off, however, is the sacrifice of a substantial amount of indoor space. Nevertheless, for Chief Pacal, such a sacrifice is wholly justified if it brings convenience to all.",
