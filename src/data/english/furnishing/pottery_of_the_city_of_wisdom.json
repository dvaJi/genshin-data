  "description": "A solid and sturdy wooden house often found to the west of Sumeru City. It is structurally similar to the buildings in Vimara Village. Using secret potions from Vimara Village to process Karmaphala Wood and hay at their first stages of decay will allow one to make buildings fireproof. Therefore, some potters use these buildings as their workshops and store large amounts of clay ingredients inside.",
