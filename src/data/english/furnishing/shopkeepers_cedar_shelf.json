  "description": "A Liyue-style cedar bookshelf of cunning workmanship. It can be used to contain books or other miscellaneous objects and comes with a desk on top.\\nMany shopkeepers use such pieces of furniture as convenient emergency counters, reaching down to grab ledgers before doing bookkeeping on the desk above.\\nDoing this too often is quite hard on the waist, however, so it may be best to place things you need more on the top grid.",
