  "description": "A special exhibit at the Magnificent Irodori Festival. It is a colorful vertical photo board with a hole in the head that allows the faces of the people taking the photo to blend in with the design, making it very popular and a must-see for visitors at the festival. This photo board depicts a happy family of tanuki. Some children have always wanted to hug the tanuki, but they can't find them, so many of them rush to take pictures with the board. The staff nearby will also be kind enough to find something for them to put their feet on so that the children's heads can reach the holes on the photo board.",
