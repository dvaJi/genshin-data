  "description": "A dye tank often found in the desert region with a base made of fine grains of stone. The interior of the five-layered tank was crafted using clay to prevent dyes from staining its walls and consequently contaminating other colors. The clay surface also facilitates the removal of mineral deposits after use. Many of the desert dwellers' clothing have been colored using these dye tanks.",
