  "description": "The fountain seen in the Grand Bazaar in front of the Zubayr Theater. Its mist is able to bring a cool breeze to the audience. The complex shape of the fountain meant that craftsmen needed to meticulously sculpt and polish it from a single piece of white stone, resulting in its astronomical price. Some legends also consider this fountain to be one of the symbols of the Grand Bazaar's prosperity.",
