  "name": "Composite Timber Long-Distance Hand Cart",
  "description": "A cart assembled from a mix of Brightwood and Athel Wood. All of its components were designed with quick disassembly and replacement in mind, allowing for both stability and ease of maintenance during long trips. These carts may have to constantly travel between the rainforest and desert â€” two places with entirely different climates. Thus, they were crafted using wood from these two regions to ensure that its critical load-bearing structure stays intact throughout the trip.",
