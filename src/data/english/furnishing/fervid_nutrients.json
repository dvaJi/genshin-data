  "description": "A plant with a strange canopy and a trunk that twists wherever it pleases. Thankfully, the texture is not overly soft, and the plant can still produce useful timber.\\nBased on the scholars' experiment results, the canopy of these plants function as \"soil nutrient indicators.\" The brighter orange the canopy is, the more fertile the soil below. Therefore, areas such as Pardis Dhyai's research fields will also grow these plants.",
