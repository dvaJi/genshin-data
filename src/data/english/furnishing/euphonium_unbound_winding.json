  "description": "An elegant furnishing crafted out of flawless white porcelain. It seems to have evolved from an age-old Liyue instrument, like a manifestation of a thousand celestial larks. This furnishing can reproduce melodious tunes, restore each delicate note, and let the music drift with the wind to every corner of the Realm Within.\\nOne sunny afternoon, a half-asleep Tubby rummaged through her teapot on a whim and found these wonderful furnishings. According to Tubby, a certain adepti with black hair and golden eyes wanted to temporarily change the melody echoing in the Realm Within to match the aesthetic of the tea on the table when he was having a small gathering with his friends in the Realm Within. Ping then combined the characteristics of various musical instruments to create these wonderful furnishings to control the rhythm in the cave in the pot and imparted these skills to Tubby. These two \"Euphonium Unbound\" furnishings are Tubby's masterpieces, which not only reproduce the music of those days but also interpret the melodies hidden in certain special objects.",
