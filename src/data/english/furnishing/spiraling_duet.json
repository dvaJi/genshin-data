  "description": "These two \"butterflies\" are constantly whirling and soaring elegantly within this fixed space that has a beautiful pedestal as its central axis. The interlocking paths they take in flight are so mesmerizing that even close observation will not easily reveal the difference between them and ordinary butterflies.\\nIn truth, each of these butterflies is a truly fantastic machine in its own right, the fruits of two researchers' well-honed knowledge. These ingenious devices have been combined into a fixed display that combines a unique landscape with static and dynamic aesthetics alike.",
