  "description": "A courtyard gate made of Aralia Wood that has a bulletin board on it. As the hot spring water needs to be heated in advance, the preparation time is difficult to control, so the operators usually mark the opening hours of the hot spring on the board. However, in The Realm Within where Sub-Space Creation energy pervades, the hot springs can maintain an optimal temperature for a long time, and naturally, they never close.",
