  "description": "A folding screen delicately crafted by the most skillful artisans. Its frame is made from Sandbearer Wood with a vermillion finish, and the finest silk was selected as its fabric. Among the multitude of splendid decorations at the Lantern Rite, this folding screen can be considered a rare masterpiece. The painting on it depicts a misty mountain view, as if one is standing atop the peaks in Minlin and gazing into the distance.",
