  "name": "Mansion Pagoda â€” Tree of Pondering",
  "description": "A pagoda from Sumeru Mansion: Meditative Retreat built around twin ancient trees, one large and one small. The flowers on their crowns are of moderate size but act as one of the most important founts of fragrance in the Sublime Spicewood. They also have an otherworldly characteristic; no matter the distance from the trees, the fragrance will always maintain an appropriate strength, just on the edge of helping one sink into deep meditation.",
