  "description": "A small bookcase commonly used to store books or important documents in the Palais Mermonia. Employees sometimes also use it to store permitted personal items. If a staff member desires to use it for the latter purpose, they can simply submit an application with the relevant information to administrative personnel. For this reason, the saying \"Little Helper for work, Cabernet in the cabinet\" has become popular among the Palais Mermonia staff.",
