  "description": "This is a plain, ocher vase. Compared with the materials used for earliest pottery, the ones used to produce such a piece have been upgraded to the point where they may be regarded as real clay, and thus the plasticity, quality, and shelf-life of the products have all been significantly increased.\\nHowever, such clay is only available on the border between the desert and the rainforest. Perhaps it was due to the inhospitable nature of the area towards plant growth, or the rainforest proving poor soil for heavy excavation and mining, but clay was brought from the deserts by merchants for the longest time, and those who sold clay thus made a fortune, attracting more people to the business and causing the price of clay to soar continuously. It was not until the Akademiya started to rein in the situation and issue regulations to restrict the price of clay that this unreasonable chaos was stopped and ceased for good.",
