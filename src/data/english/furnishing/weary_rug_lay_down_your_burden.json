  "description": "A hand-woven square carpet with excellent quality and great stain resistance. It can be found at the Weary Inn. Its exterior may appear somewhat rough, but that is intentional on the part of the innkeeper. From their perspective, the main guests are weary competitors or travelers, and an all-too-luxurious rug might add to their already leaden psychological burden, making relaxation difficult. A slightly rougher handwoven carpet, by contrast, not only allows them to use it without said pressure but also creates a homey, comforting atmosphere.",
