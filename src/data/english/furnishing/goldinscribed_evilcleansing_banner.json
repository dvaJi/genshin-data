  "description": "This crimson banner with gold embroidery is made using exceptionally thick cloth such that its colors will not fade even after many years of battering by wind and rain. It is said that the unique shape of these banners is derived from their history as war banners and ritual flags. As such, they not only symbolize the joy of a festival's coming but also works to expel evil. As such, flags of this kind must be kept idle for a time after festivities to allow their power to return, before they may once again be used.",
