  "name": "White Fish Tallow Candle: Evenlight",
  "description": "Specific types of fish are selected, de-boned and boiled into ointment, which is then refined over a small fire into its absolute essence before being added to traditional spices and secret herbs. The mixture is then allowed to coagulate into a fixed shape before being chopped and processed further... The main use of these candles, complicated in their make as they are, is to light up shrines and wards.\\nIt is in the end an item to be offered up to a god, and so though it may seem quite ordinary, its price is anything but.",
