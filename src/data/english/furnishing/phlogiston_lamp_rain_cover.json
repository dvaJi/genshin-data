  "name": "Phlogiston Lamp: Rain Cover",
  "description": "A Natlan lamp with a simple design, featuring a metal lampshade and a phlogiston-based light source. It has a special umbrella-shaped cover on top, making it easier for people to lift and carry by hand. This cover also serves as a waterproof and steam-resistant barrier to protect the lamp's carrier. Though the phlogiston inside would not be extinguished by rain, its high heat would vaporize large amounts of water upon contact, potentially burning the carrier's hand.",
