  "description": "A hanging light with fabric stretched over Brightwood frames underneath leaves blooming in the shape of petals. The light is decorated with Sumeru-style colored paintings, while the wick uses extracts from bioluminescent plants that have been mixed with a small amount of dye and distilled several times to arrive at the most optimal concentration. Its light is gentle and elegant, sufficient to illuminate a wide indoor space.",
