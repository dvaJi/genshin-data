  "description": "A tranquil and noble white flower with buds as pure and elegant as silver bells and a gentle, refreshing fragrance. Many believe it is related to the Lumidouce Bell, and so they call it the \"Blancdouce Bell.\"\\nSome artists have written that these short-lived flowers represent hard-earned happiness that is difficult to hold onto. However, it is said that the residents of Petrichor have found a way to extend their flowering season, meaning that \"happiness\" is something that can be achieved and held onto through hard work.",
