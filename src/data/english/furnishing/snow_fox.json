  "description": "A sly animal as elusive as a fairy that often appears in folk stories, symbolizing unusual cunning and ancient memories.\\nIts coat of thick, white fur helps conceal it amongst the snow. Living in harsh environments has sharpened both its wits and sense of smell. \\nEven in the jade fields of the Realm Within, the whereabouts of the Snow Foxes are constantly changing and unpredictable. They sometimes jump out of the bushes suddenly, giving Tubby a shock and waking her from her slumber.",
