  "description": "A seemingly average potted pine.\\nThis form of potted plant is very popular amongst some of the old folks in Hanamizaka. It is said that when they were young, they would meet their friends under the pines. In the early morning hours, they would form groups and go out before returning by evening, their spirits high. So the days passed, and so the years crept away, until \"departure\" suddenly announced itself, and some no longer appeared ever again under those pine trees â€” and before they knew it, their hair was full snow-white.\\nDo they remember the old bygone days by placing these plants in front of their doors, or they perhaps hold some expectation... for a surprise reunion under the trees? To this, the old folks know not the answer.",
