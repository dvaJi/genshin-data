  "description": "Bright lavender flowers are set off by the lake-blue flowers, as both are lovingly planted with care in this composite potted arrangement placed in an unusually-shaped pot.\\nThe lavender flowers used in the potted arrangement are said to be able to purify the air with their petals and fragrance, their mysterious powers driving away mosquitoes and curing disease. They are said to symbolize \"cleanliness and health,\" while the incredibly vigorous lake-blue flowers have a similar meaning. For this reason, the residents of Petrichor like to grow these two types together, not only due to their complementary aesthetics but also because of the hopes for a better life they embody.",
