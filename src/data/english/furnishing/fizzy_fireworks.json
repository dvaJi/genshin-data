  "description": "A sturdy, bottle-shaped model inspired by the ever-popular Joypop Bottles of \"Easybreeze Holiday Resort,\" cast in jubilant orange.\\nOriginally, these effervescent beverages were deemed troublesome to store and prone to explosive mishaps, and thus seldom favored. That changed when one fateful mishap caused a bottle to burst, releasing foam like \"fizzy fireworks.\" Reimagined as an attraction, the drink quickly became one of the resort's most beloved refreshments.",
