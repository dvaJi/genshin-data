  "description": "An Inazuma house with a simple build and lots of room for modification. Inazuma City's population tends to tick upward, resulting in a trend of building the city outward, which has in turn caused these easily-set-up houses to become ubiquitous. When the family living on its grounds accumulate enough savings, they can then purchase the materials to perform renovations and enlargements. Though few such successful cases have come to be in recent years, the \"wish\" for a better life surely still exists within the peoples' hearts.",
