  "description": "The legendary freshwater amphibian that can spit out pearls. They are found mostly where the water is clear and the reeds grow long.\\nIt is said that their lovely hue is like the sunset upon the waters, or that the tranquility of sunset stays with them.\\nThey will combine elements that can neither be absorbed nor digested, gravel and ores within their bodies to create sparkling, shining pearls, and will spit them out when threatened to confuse and distract predators. \\nIn the safety of the Realm Within, the loaches don't have to produce their signature shining pearls at their usual speed.",
