  "name": "Lofty Tower's Floor of Trials",
  "description": "The standard flooring of a lofty tower, made from tiles of volcanic rock of varying sizes pieced together into special patterns. These unique patterns ensure reliable traction, minimizing the chances of slipping and thus making an ideal surface for running or jumping. Drawing upon experience gleaned from maintaining the Stadium of the Sacred Flame and various tribal stages, these tiles have been divided into smaller units, offering economic practicality by allowing damaged tiles to be replaced individually. This makes them perfect for those looking to create indoor arenas or training spaces.",
