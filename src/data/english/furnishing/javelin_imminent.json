  "description": "A mask shaped like a feathered crown that you can find being sold at Chuwen Fair in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. The mask's feathers are reminiscent of wings ready to strike. It is said that a wise warrior will hold their spear tight at all times and marshal their strength, such that a critical blow may be unleashed upon their foes when their guard is down.",
