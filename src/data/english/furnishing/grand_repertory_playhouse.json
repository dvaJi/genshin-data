  "description": "A large and exquisite tent made from durable, machine-dyed fabric, capable of resisting even heavy blows from clockwork meka. It was once used as the tent for the Chevalmarin Film Fantasyland's Movie Masterpiece attraction. It is said that to commemorate and restore famous scenes from classic films, the Movie Masterpieces project had strict requirements for tents, requiring both a spacious interior and a sturdy outer structure. To this end, the organizers installed multiple fixed load-bearing components in the tent to ensure its durability. Meanwhile, the vibrant red of the tent cloth blocks out light from the outside while drawing the gazes of visitors, enticing more of them inside.",
