  "name": "Hot Spring Whitestone: Secret Fire",
  "description": "White, stone-shaped mechanical structures that can be found standing around and inside hot springs. It looks like an ordinary rock, with a furnace cavity containing charcoal inside, with a flue and air vents connected to it from below. The stone facade is extremely thin and has good thermal conductivity. The preheated hot spring pool water is able to maintain a pleasant temperature for a long time thanks to the effects of such mechanisms.",
