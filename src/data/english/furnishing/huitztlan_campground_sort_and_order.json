  "description": "A medium-sized structure with a single swinging door, commonly seen among the \"Scions of the Canopy.\" The defining feature of these buildings is their strictly symmetrical internal layout. Although this design makes the interior appear somewhat cramped, which seems at odds with the \"Scions of the Canopy\"'s typically lively and dynamic lifestyle, it ensures that each visitor can enter and exit in an orderly fashion, as envisioned by the homeowner, thereby avoiding potential congestion and chaos. Such dangerous situations are precisely what Chief \"Wayna\" strives to prevent.",
