  "description": "A more striking blue paper frog model that can be placed on a \"Good Shelf\" for display.\\nXudi reveals that this model series was based on a certain superstar competitor in the Rainsong Pond jumping contest. This frog displayed great jumping prowess during the competition, leaving a deep impression on Xudi. As such, he decided to make a somewhat larger model to match the frog's excellent skills â€” in Xudi's memory, at least, this one once leaped far higher than any other.",
