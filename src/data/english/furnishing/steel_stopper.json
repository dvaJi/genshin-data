  "description": "These traditional roadblocks are used to delineate prohibited areas in peacetime, but they serve as the basic unit of a defensive line during wartime. Due to the high-density Adhigama Wood used and the addition of very large metal spikes, the weight of this roadblock is frighteningly heavy, enough to stop the head-on charge of a Sumpter Beast. As such, these roadblocks are often dismantled and moved around, set up only when they are needed.\\nThat said, there was a certain mercenary with long black-and-golden hair who once opined that \"defensive lines were made to be broken,\" breaking through such obstacles en route to tearing the opposing side's defenses to shreds. This incident was so significant that even her colleagues started to consider installing some strengthening metal structures at the intersection of these roadblocks in order to deal with foes as powerful as her.",
