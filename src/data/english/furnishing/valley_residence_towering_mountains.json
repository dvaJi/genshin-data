  "description": "Grand, solemn residential buildings that can be found in Yilong Wharf. Unlike most buildings in Yilong Wharf that have roofs made only of wood, gable-like load-bearing walls have been constructed on the top and sides to expand the available space. This design allows the house to have an open interior space and a magnificent exterior without changing the original foundations. Truly, an example of inspired craftsmanship.",
