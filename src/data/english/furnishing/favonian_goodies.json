This isn't a report, you know! We're here to make people happy, so even our notes should sound happy!'\"\\n\"'Paimon stated that 'You don't have to write this stuff down. Just cross it out or something...'\"\\n\"Ten minutes after we opened for business, Paimon accidentally knocked a plate of Ham over, cleaned it up, before eating it herself. We shall just have to charge this to her account...\"\\n\"Regardless, since this is the first time we are running a shop, we must all make use of our previous experience and work together to accomplish our aims!\"",
