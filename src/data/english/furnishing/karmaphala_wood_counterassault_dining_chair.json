  "description": "Ordinary dining chairs made from Karmaphala Wood that can be seen everywhere in Sumeru City. These chairs are so ordinary that few people have given them a special nickname. However, after a well-publicized incident where a drunk student tried to arrest a chair but was ultimately subdued by it, everyone gradually committed to memory the counter-assault properties of the chair and acknowledged its safety.",
