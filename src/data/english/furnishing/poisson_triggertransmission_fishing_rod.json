  "description": "A fully automatic fishing rod designed by combining the rich fishing experience available in Poisson and complex clockwork technology. Despite its enormous size, once properly assembled, even complete beginners can easily catch large fish using it. Of course, this doesn't mean that this tool is suitable for everyone, as this fishing rod has a complex clockwork mechanism that requires meticulous and thorough maintenance. Otherwise, malfunctions such as reel failure or hook detachment may occur frequently.\\nConsidering the high costs and difficulty of learning the necessary maintenance skills, learning traditional fishing techniques with a relaxed mindset might be a viable alternative to using this device.",
