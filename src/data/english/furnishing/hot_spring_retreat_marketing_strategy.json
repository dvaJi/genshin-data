  "description": "A semi-open structure with a double-layered roof, featuring a more elongated design, is exemplified by \"Xochicuicatl Records.\"\\nIt is said that this elongated store layout is a unique sales strategy of \"Xochicuicatl Records.\" Given the relatively small size of records and their need for focused customer attention, this layout helps mitigate visual fatigue and prevent confusion between primary and secondary items, compared to a spacious, flat display. Additionally, it facilitates the proprietor's ability to inspect the store's arrangement, preventing customers from surreptitiously rearranging their records.",
