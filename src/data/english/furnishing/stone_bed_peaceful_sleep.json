  "description": "A single bed made from stone, found in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. At first glance, you might think such a heavy bed would be hard and uncomfortable to sleep on, but thanks to the plush wool-filled mattress and skin-friendly handwoven bedding, the actual sleeping experience is surprisingly comfortable. It is said that, after a night's sleep on this bed, even the most fatigued of traveling merchants will wake up rejuvenated and brimming with energy, feeling as though they had been blessed by the Wayob. On top of this, the bed incorporates clever storage functionality, with its hollow frame allowing users to stash valuables beneath the mattress, ensuring that they remain safe without disrupting their owner's quality of sleep. This sense of security, perhaps, is another secret behind the bed's seemingly miraculous revitalizing properties.",
