  "description": "This wooden plate contains Zaytun Peaches, albeit ones that are not yet ripe...\\nZaytun Peaches do indeed have a rather firm texture, though their circumstances are a little different in the searing deserts. For if one buys fully ripened Zaytun Peaches from Caravan Ribat, they would have already lost most of their moisture to the hot weather by the time they get to Aaru Village — indeed, they might even have rotted by then.\\nAs such, the villagers and the caravan merchants came together to think of a storage solution — first, they would wash as-yet unripe Peaches and scatter some specially-blended spices over them, before allowing them to soak inside barrels of wine. This way, all that is needed will be to bring the Zaytun Peaches back to Aaru Village before leaving them be for a while until the light alcohol on the surface volatilizes, thus giving the fruits a texture almost identical to what they would have had if freshly-picked and ripe. And if eaten the moment they are taken out from the wine barrel, one will get a uniquely crisp and refreshing flavor — a true Aaru Village special found nowhere else.",
