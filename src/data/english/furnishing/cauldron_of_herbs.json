  "description": "A cauldron that cost the alchemist Hajanad an arm and a leg to acquire. Now that she has discovered a brand new research path, she no longer needs such traditional apparatus to create potions. To express her gratitude for your assistance with the testing of the \"Remelting Tablets,\" she gifted it to you as some sort of teaware that you may brew your tea with. Since it can transfer heat in a rapid and balanced manner, it can actually help release the utmost flavor of some high-end tea leaves. However, due to its reasonably unorthodox structure, it can be slightly inconvenient to pour tea with while keeping the leaves inside when compared with everyday teapots. Some may argue, though, that it confers an \"academic sense of ceremony\" upon the process.",
