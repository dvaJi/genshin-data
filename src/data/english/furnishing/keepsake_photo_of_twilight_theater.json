  "description": "A lovely photo frame that contains a group photo of the Twilight Theater troupe members. You obtained this as a thank-you gift for helping the troupe stage the \"Tale of the Sword-Wielding Princess.\"\\nA lovingly-written script requires an equally passionate interpretation, and the positions of the actors also matter greatly. Your careful adjustments allowed this performance to go off splendidly, much to the fervent plaudits of the actors.",
