  "description": "A mysterious table of unknown origins. The table's colors are very striking indeed, while the surface feels very gentle, almost like shining but supple glass. The key to this feeling lies in the mysterious paint used, the clever use of which can give otherwise unremarkable furniture the look of high-grade furnishings.",
