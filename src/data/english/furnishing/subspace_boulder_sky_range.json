  "description": "A Sub-Space Boulder that hangs high in the air. Its core is made of Plaustrite unique to Liyue and it is made by casting rock masses into a broad floating platform. Its load-bearing capacity is excellent, and no matter how many things you build on top of it, it will neither slant nor sink. You could even build a floating town if you could link enough of these Sub-Space Boulders together.",
