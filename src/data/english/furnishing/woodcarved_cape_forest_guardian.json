  "description": "A dashing and comfortable wood-carved cape that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the cape of a Forest Ranger who is always ready to help others. Aranara in fairy tales all live in the woods, so naturally, there are plenty of stories with Aranara patrolling the forest and safeguarding the tranquility of this lush land. And these warm-hearted Aranara have earned themselves a title similar to the Forest Rangers. They are addressed as the Forest Guardians.",
