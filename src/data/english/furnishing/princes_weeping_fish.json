  "description": "Fish-shaped pillows that can be seen at The Cat's Tail. Designed with sobbing expressions that linger on in the mind's eye, these pillows offer relief to customers when held or used as a backrest. It is as if the fishes are \"crying\" on behalf of those that lean on them. Hence, they are often rated quite highly by customers.\\nLegend has it that before Prince became the respected Duel Saint of Cats and attained its present stature, it also suffered a few brutal defeats. In such situations, Prince only wanted to lay upon a pillow that wasn't too soft, wasn't too hard, wasn't too flat, and wasn't too round before drifting off to sleep. Diona and Margaret searched for a long time but couldn't find what they needed. Thankfully, after a successful match, Prince had a wonderful dream, and after Shuyun elaborated on the details, Margaret finally found proper inspiration to have this unique pillow custom-made.",
