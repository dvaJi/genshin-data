  "description": "A unique piece of furniture that shares the same design aesthetic as Bimarstan, which can be seen in the northwest of Sumeru City. Its long and narrow build provides plenty of room for medicine to be stored. For patients that require more ventilation or open-air, plafonds can be provided for additional outdoor beds.\\nIt is said that the Akademiya allocates special funding to the maintenance of these furnishings in medical areas to ensure that the people of Sumeru have a nice, restful environment to stay while they get treated at Bimarstan free of charge.",
