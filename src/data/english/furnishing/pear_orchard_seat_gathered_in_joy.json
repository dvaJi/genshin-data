  "description": "A bench made from Fragrant Cedar Wood. It has a simple design and takes up little space, making it easy to place and store. Legend has it that performers of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe would sit on these benches to take a break after everything was ready, or to watch the performance from behind the curtain. More often than not, however, these benches are reserved for enthusiastic guests â€” there are usually not enough seats around the round tables when it comes to formal performances. In such circumstances, Yun-Han Opera Troupe will add such benches at its discretion to make the most of the venue and allow more people to enjoy the opera without disturbing each other.",
