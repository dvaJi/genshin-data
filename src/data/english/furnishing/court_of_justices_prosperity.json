It is a product of early forays into modular architecture, and an example given in the Court of Fontaine Standards for Exterior Wall Decorations. Once construction using slag cement matured, architects believed rapid assembly of houses on a large scale was possible by making all the load-bearing walls in advance and using large clockwork meka to assist in construction.\\nHowever, despite many attempts to adjust the coloration, an icy cold and gloomy gray were the only possible outcomes for slag cement. Housing and indoor architecture would be far too plain if built like that, and so light yellow bricks are still necessary for the exterior wall panels while tiles or wood flooring are required indoors. Thus, concerns about aesthetics and livability won out over the time savings promised by modular construction. Thus, the architects turned to another form of modular construction design that focused on structure and reserving space for internal piping.\\nOf course, even if the architects succeed, there may not be much demand in Fontaine unless the Fontaine Research Institute is rebuilt â€” which is another complicated issue in itself...",
