  "description": "A small shrub often found growing in the territory of the Masters of the Night-Wind, with leaves both slender and beautiful. Its color is akin to the violet hues of sunset. Due to the denseness of its leaves, it's a popular hiding spot for both small animals and the tiny treasures of the tribe's children.",
