  "description": "Coral branches that may be found in shallow waters, whose color shifts as you look at it from bottom to top, starting light purple and finishing with bright powder blue, both of which glow faintly in the dark.\\nThese coral are very rarely found near Narukami Island, but when war breaks out, one can sometimes find merchants bringing some to sell as potted plants.\\nThanks to these sales, most people have a pretty decent opinion of Watatsumi Island on the whole, believing it to be an island surrounded by beautiful coral — such opinions further puzzle them as to why the Shogunate and the resistance would be at war.",
