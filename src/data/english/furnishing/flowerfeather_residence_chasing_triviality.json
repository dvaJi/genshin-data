  "description": "A large building adorned with colorful graffiti signs, commonly seen within the Flower-Feather Clan.\\nThe tribe has certain restrictions on house decoration and renovation, usually allowing personal creativity only in minor decorative projects. This rule is closely connected to the tribe's competitive culture. As one of the proudest tribes in Natlan, the members of the Flower-Feather Clan tend to compete fiercely in various contests to showcase their excellence. However, in unique environments like Quahuacan Cliff, excessive modifications and decorations can pose a threat to the safety of both the buildings and the entire platform, with potentially disastrous consequences. Therefore, the Flower-Feather Clan restricts decorations to those that do not alter the structural integrity or form of the buildings.",
