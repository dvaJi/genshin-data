  "description": "This eminently useful variety of stone is visually indistinguishable from other kinds of brown stone on the exterior. However, when subjected to high heat, it develops adhesive properties and draws in the ash produced by burning firewood. This makes it a useful substance in maintaining a clean kitchen, and has earned it the name \"Ashen Stone.\" It has also been used to build stoves.",
