  "description": "A model biscuit model made from fabric, inspired by the renowned Natlanese delicacy, Saurus Crackers. The model exquisitely replicates the original saurian-shaped cookies, making it look particularly enticing. Due to its highly realistic appearance, it is imperative to store them away from saurian whelps to prevent accidental consumption.",
