  "description": "A lovely Inazuma-style mansion created for the Serenitea Pot by the \"Silken Print.\"\\nOver the centuries, the architectural style of Inazuma has undergone a great many improvements, and it has also come to adopt many of the advantages of styles from other countries. This Refined Estate combines some upper-class elements with some belonging to the common folk, thus coming to possess a unique structure and plentiful space. Its interior is built just right, elegant but not overbearingly extravagant, uniquely charming and intimate, almost as if friends of yours from Inazuma had a hand in its creation for you and Paimon.",
