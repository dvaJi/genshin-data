  "description": "A Teleport Waypoint created using Sub-Space Creation. You can use this waypoint to travel from place to place in your Realm.\\nThis kind of waypoint bathes in the Realm's adeptal energy, and will not lose function over time. However, Tubby says that putting too many of these waypoints in might throw the adeptal energy in the realm into disarray, which can cause her massive insomnia. And if she gets insomnia, the following things could happen: buildings could end up in the wrong places, trees might go flying into the sky, the mountains and stones may twist and turn...\\nEither way, it's best that you not put too many waypoints in your teapot.",
