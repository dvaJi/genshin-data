  "description": "\"These unassuming plants have golden leaves that possess strong fibers that, once appropriately treated, can be used as ropes to restrain criminals.\\nThe latest edition of the Matra manual has this to say concerning this species of desert shrub.\\nSome inexperienced Matra have made the mistake of discarding any seemingly unnecessary loads while conducting long-range treks, only to find themselves short of rope to restrain criminals with once they have captured them. These shrubs could come in very handy indeed at such moments.",
