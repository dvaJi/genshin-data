  "description": "A classic parasol found frequently upon sandy coasts, renowned for its excellent sun-shielding properties.\\nAt high noon, when the sun's rays grow fierce, those less fond of tanning often seek refuge beneath its modest yet cool shade â€” iced drink in hand, feet nestled in warm, grainy sands, as the briny sea breeze whispers by. Many a beachside vendor also employs such umbrellas to create shaded stalls, ensuring that the blinding sunlight does not hinder patrons in their browsing.",
