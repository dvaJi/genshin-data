  "description": "Snowman eyes made using two stones. Can be used to make a Puffy Snowman.\\nThe children have called these eyes the \"Treasure Hunters,\" but not necessarily because snowmen with such eyes can lead them into fields of plenty, but because they tend to find some interesting \"treasures\" while searching for stones of the right size for such eyes. Pleasant little surprises, you know?",
