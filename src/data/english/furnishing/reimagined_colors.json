  "description": "A striking structure of timber and stone, echoing the design of \"Chromaflair Studio.\" A gift from Zolton and Zolin, this piece serves as a monument of reconciliation and renewal. Unlike his former bold color choices, Zolton has this time selected a blue theme that harmonizes with the market surroundings. This is perhaps a gesture to mark the moment when Zolin helped him recognize his error and begin anew, grounded and sincere.",
