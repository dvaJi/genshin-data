  "description": "A door frame made from Aralia Wood that has the same design as the front gate of the Police Station. This door frame has its own unique design, which is said to invoke the \"storm clouds\" and represent the great ability of the station to keep the peace all over the land of thunder, and thus speak of its ability to deal with many matters in Inazuma City itself.\\nThat said, few citizens actually pay much attention to these design features. Rather, it is the birds that seem to enjoy nesting in such places, a fact that has given any Doushin in charge of clean up a world of trouble.",
