  "description": "This building can be found in Aaru Village, and is most often used by ordinary villagers. Its shape is more squarish, and it strikes a balance between floor space and living space, thus making it suitable for medium-sized families. If Sumeru researchers or guests of a similar kind were to come to Aaru Village, these would be their accommodations as well.\\nThe guards on duty will also use buildings of this kind as their barracks, and they can climb through a hidden skylight to the roof to survey their surroundings.\\nFor the guards, the desert surrounds them on all sides with danger, and the act of splitting their time between rest and standing guard can be quite tiring indeed. However, as long as they have the aid of the Guardian with differently-colored eyes, these troubles will seem as if most far away indeed.",
