  "description": "A small floor lamp from the Fortress of Meropide that, despite its small size, is surprisingly tough. Many people use it as a dumbbell to train their arms and shoulder muscles. People who train a lot in this manner can even tell the minute differences in weight between the various floor lamps.\\nA certain former inmate of the Fortress wrote a workout manual series called \"Ironhammer: Inmate Workouts\" based on these simple yet effective training methods and also gained swift renown as a fitness coach.\\nAlas, due to material safety concerns at the Fortress, these lamps have all been locked down â€” never again shall the inmates torment the guards' eyes by repeatedly lifting the lamps and putting them down.",
