  "name": "Stadium \"Round Seating\" Bench",
  "description": "A stone bench used for short rests that can only rarely be found in outdoor areas of the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. This bench design features a special curve that allows four such benches, when joined, to align perfectly with the circular tables in the arena. Because these provide more seating than standard chairs, the corresponding round tables can accommodate more people at once. As a result, some vendors in the arena use these benches to avoid the awkward situation of not having enough seating during peak periods.",
