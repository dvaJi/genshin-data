  "description": "Ingeniously arched courtyard gates can be found in many locations throughout Chenyu Vale. As Chenyu Vale is quite mountainous with obvious changes in elevation and narrow streets and narrower alleys, courtyards with normal dimensions would appear to have cramped layouts, while the requirements for wider courtyards are too many. For these reasons, some door frames make meticulous use of the height of the frame itself to widen one's field of view, aiming to enhance the feeling of the openness of the space.\\nLegends say that someone passed through such a door and saw a tall mountain in the distance, and suddenly felt very open-minded and generous. Perhaps this embodies the beauty of \"getting straight to the summit\" unique to these gates.",
