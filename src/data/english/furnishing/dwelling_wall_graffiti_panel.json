  "description": "The low walls of a lofty tower, carved with golden reliefs and simple embossed patterns, exuding a refined and dignified elegance. They work equally well as both internal partitions and protective outer walls.\\nRather than purchasing ready-made decorations, the people of Natlan generally prefer decorating walls with their own graffiti. Thus, built-in ornamentation on Natlan-style courtyard walls is usually confined to the edges, with any central relief kept minimal and unobtrusive so that it does not steal the limelight.",
