  "description": "A cardboard model fashioned after Nochtli Lackey, the \"Speedy Wanderer,\" whose menacing appearance is enough to unsettle even the bravest children.\\nRenowned for its exceptional speed, this opponent leaves challengers little room for error. Only those with sharp reflexes and keen aim stand a chance at prevailing.\\n\"Stay where you are, or I'll send you to the Night Kingdom!\"\\nTake heed: the \"Speedy Wanderer\" is ever-vigilant. Should you approach too closely, it may very well choose mutual destruction over retreat.",
