  "description": "A simple, practical but slightly expensive metal bucket hat. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nThe children often worry that their snowmen might be damaged by some mischievous flying birds. To prevent this, some opt to bring the sturdiest metal bucket they can find at home to help pile snow up while making the snowman, before capping off their work's completion by placing the bucket over the snowman's head as a helmet. Two birds with one stone, as they say.",
