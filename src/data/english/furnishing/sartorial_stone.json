  "description": "A type of stone that is equally common in both Mondstadt and Liyue. Because its color is similar to that of a fabric popular in ancient times, it has ended up with the name \"Sartorial Stone.\" Incidentally, the commoners who wore the type of fabric in question also drew on the tenacity of the stone for a morale boost.",
