  "description": "Legends say that this kind of stone used to only appear in arid regions such as the deserts of Sumeru, but it can now easily be found all over Liyue.\\nConsidering nobody would have manually transported it to Liyue from so far away, some otherwise-serious scholars came up with the rather audacious theory of \"ley line shift,\" simply for everyone's amusement. The theory was inspired by the situation with Chasm's Doorstep.",
