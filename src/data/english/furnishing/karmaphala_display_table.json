  "description": "A long cabinet made from painted Karmaphala Wood boards and covered with an elegant tablecloth. Often found in Sumeru's merchant districts.\\nIt is said that for a time, the Akademiya issued a special order that \"shops that sell different goods must use different colored tablecloths for each type of goods.\" This order, however, was quickly rescinded as the merchants lacked the variety of colors needed to match their inventory of goods. This incident also proved to be a classic blunder on the part of certain researchers, in that they lacked understanding of society at large.",
