  "description": "A rescue swim ring that can be hung on the wall, commonly seen in the People of the Springs. It is said that the first batch of \"Savey-Wavey Life Rings\" was originally designed for emergency rescue. The key change was to replace the original water-colored graffiti of the \"Bobbly-Wobbly Water Donut\" with an eye-catching crimson pattern, which significantly improves its visibility on the water's surface. That way, those in need of rescue can quickly locate the ring and swim to it, saving valuable time in an emergency. Nowadays, thanks to its bright and vibrant colors, the \"Savey-Wavey Life Ring\" has gradually become a popular choice among both tourists and businesses, and is commonly chosen as an everyday swim ring.",
