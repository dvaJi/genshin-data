  "description": "Commonly seen in the Court of Fontaine, this tree, in theory, bears a resemblance to the Cypress Tree found in natural environments. However, according to the Greenery Court of Fontaine Standards for Urban Decorative Plants, ornamental plants in the city must be sorted based on height, shape, color, scent, and biological influences. Even if other tree species are planted, city management will assign gardeners to trim their crowns into standard shapes, so that trees will not be recognized solely based on appearance.",
