  "description": "A plant commonly found in the wilds of Natlan, characterized by its vividly colored, fleshy leaves.\\nIt is said that the leaves of this plant are repositories of water and nutrients, making them a potential source of emergency food. However, besides the fact that they taste extremely bitter, they also contain allergens, meaning that even cooking the plant will not guarantee its safety for consumption. Consequently, courier survival guides only recommend eating it in the most dire of situations â€” in other words, as a last resort.",
