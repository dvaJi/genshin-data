  "description": "A chirpy little bird, found in nooks and crannies all over Teyvat.\\nSnowy white from tip to toe, it enjoys a carefree existence in its snowswept natural habitat. Snow Finches are naturally adapted to cold climates and are highly sensitive to changes in temperature. In warmer environments, they become somewhat fatigued.\\nSometimes, these birds will gather around Tubby and doze off together, forming a \"drowsy formation.\" Even people who are in high spirits will be affected when they approach this formation, starting to yawn and feel more sleepy.",
