  "description": "Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka groups, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\\nLegend has it that when maintenance meks were initially deployed, researchers made various demos to prove the technology for organizations like the Fishing Association, providing demo types along with instruction manuals. This was to explain the origin and features of this fish-shaped meka to the people of Fontaine, ensuring people wouldn't be confused or harmed when seeing them. However, the aggressiveness of the meka was overestimated, and the skill of the anglers underrated. With the disbandment of the maintenance project team, these technical demo meka are but decorations, offering a glimpse into the intriguing technological development of Fontaine.",
