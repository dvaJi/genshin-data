  "description": "A standard Fontaine metal-glass composite building used for selling fresh fruits and vegetables. Compared to traditional stores, it occupies a smaller space and can be set up almost anywhere. However, it does not have any storage space, thus the entire stock might spoil if not sold that day. The owners of such stores typically make small purchases, with some opting to become distributors for larger operations like department stores, so they don't bear any inventory risks and receive a cut from the larger department stores they supply.",
