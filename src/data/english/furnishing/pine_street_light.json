  "description": "A street light made of Pine Wood. Often seen standing on both sides of the road in the countryside around Mondstadt, where they have stood for a long time.\\nStreet lights also used to be a common sight in the wild and the mountains, but many were destroyed when monster activity in these areas increased.\\nThanks to the efforts of the Knights of Favonius, the monster threat has been quelled for the time being, and new street lights have been placed along the roads.",
