  "description": "The corridor corner of the Illusory Annex is characterized by elegant curves. It is said that this design, known as \"manifold,\" originated from a certain Fontaine Research Institute researcher. Tasked with the seemingly unreasonable task of finding a structure that was \"completely rigid at the microscopic scale but entirely flexible in its overall structure,\" he intentionally drew an arc composed of line segments and published a paper titled \"The Manifold Hypothesis.\" The paper sparked intense discussion once published, and people eventually discovered that this seemingly satirical paper indeed concealed a novel approach to conceptualizing space. In the end, the design named \"manifold\" officially emerged, and the term \"manifold discovery\" became a new expression to describe unexpectedly finding something new.",
