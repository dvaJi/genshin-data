  "description": "Lamps commonly seen in places such as Aaru Village. The Athel Wood frame is combined with the shell made of cloth lampshade to achieve its unique shape. Thanks to its clever design, the lamp is so stable that it is said to be unable to be blown down by a sandstorm.\\nIn Aaru Village, there was a rumor of \"light sand.\" Long ago, there was a type of fine sand in the deep desert, which was constantly illuminated by the hot sun and retained the sunlight. The earliest craftsmen who made this kind of lamp used the fine sand as the light source in the lampshade. In reality, the light source used in these lamps is also made from materials derived from plants, and a little mixing can go a long way using plants not uncommon in the desert.",
