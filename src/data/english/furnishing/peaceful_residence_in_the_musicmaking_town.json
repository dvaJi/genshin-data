  "description": "A grand, elegant residence found in Petrichor. Unlike the buildings in the Court of Fontaine, the houses in Petrichor tend to have separate, dedicated spaces for non-residential areas and chimneys, and are built as separate buildings. Though such designs take up more space, they increase fire safety and provide a cleaner living space. In a place like Petrichor with limited living space available, this is the best choice.",
