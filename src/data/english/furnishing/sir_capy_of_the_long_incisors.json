  "description": "A charming cardboard replica of the miniature Capybara, faithfully portraying its perpetually drowsy, squinting visage.\\nMost of the time, \"Sir Capy of the Long Incisors\" remains motionless with eyes closed, nearly indistinguishable from this very model. But when danger strikes, it awakens, then promptly digs a hole and flees. \"Knowing how to pick one's battles is a virtue of the knight,\" they say, and such pragmatism is the secret to this knight's continued survival.",
