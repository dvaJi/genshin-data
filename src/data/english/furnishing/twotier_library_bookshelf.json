  "description": "A bookshelf made from Cuihua Wood, above which many miscellaneous items can be mounted.\\nThe Knights had such shelves made to make the retrieval of books by researchers more convenient. The original intention was to only put some special collections in, but the store of books was so great that all manner of book collections were included in the end.\\nSuch a free-form display of tomes is, well, somewhat fitting of Mondstadt's character.",
