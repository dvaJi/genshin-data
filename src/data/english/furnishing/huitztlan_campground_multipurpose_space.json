  "description": "A medium-sized building with an annex and a wooden door large enough for a vehicle to pass through, observable within the \"Scions of the Canopy.\" The main structure employs a \"columnar\" design â€” utilizing independent load-bearing columns to support the entire construction. This design allows for a larger footprint and more usable internal space. Meanwhile, the adjacent annex, separated from the main structure by internal partitions, can serve different functions.\\nThus, this type of building is often used as a warehouse. Next to the \"Scions of the Canopy\"'s Obsidian Totem Pole stands such a structure, functioning simultaneously as a warehouse and residence, showcasing the unique functionality of this building style.",
