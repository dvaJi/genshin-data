  "description": "A low millstone made from metal and stone, supported by a Flammabomb Wood stand. Found all throughout Natlan, it is primarily used to grind hard ingredients, serving as a crucial tool in the preparation of saurian feed. While saurians have sharper teeth than humans, it is said that the amount of raw food in their diets leads to significant wear over time. As a result, older saurians are particularly susceptible to various dental issues and knock-on ailments. For this reason, nowadays, the people of Natlan prepare two types of meals for their saurians â€” one of hard, raw food to maintain their biting strength, and another of soft, ground feed to prevent excessive tooth wear.",
