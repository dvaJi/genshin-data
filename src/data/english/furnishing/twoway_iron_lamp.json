  "description": "A lamp crafted using thin metal. The desert dwellers tend to make the most out of every material, so they opted for low-quality iron pieces. However, the true strength of this material will only be revealed when it gets a few bumps or scratches. The lamp has a relatively exquisite exterior and decent functionality. One can even switch between fluorescent light sources or open flames according to need, making this lamp a favorite among the desert dwellers.",
