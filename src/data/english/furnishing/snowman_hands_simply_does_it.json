  "description": "A pair of hands that naturally point downward. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nSuch snowman hands are the simplest to build, such that even the slightest amount of effort will see it done with ease. This best displays the \"efficiency above all\" attitude of some Mondstadt children who only wish to quickly finish their snowy artworks, prizing quantity as a quality all on its own. By the time others have built but one snowman, it is quite possible for such children to have already started mustering a small snowman army.",
