  "description": "A fence corner constructed out of Aralia Wood. Contrary to the usual principles upon which fences and walls are designed, the spaces between the wooden boards here are so large that a fully armored person could slip through the middle. The reason for this design choice is rather obvious — which is to allow the Yoriki standing guard to have good sightlines and prevent any accidents that might stem from \"the brightest lights casting the darkest shadows.\"",
