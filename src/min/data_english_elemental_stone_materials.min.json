[{"id":"basalt_pillar","name":"Basalt Pillar","description":"A pillar formed by the shell of a Geo Hypostasis, composed of high-density Geo energy.<br/>It is a testament to Geo's status as the heaviest of the elements. Maybe the reason a Geo Hypostasis creates this pillar out of its shell and raises itself is just to get closer to the sky, not to combat enemies.","source":["Dropped by Lv.30+ Geo Hypostases"],"rarity":4},{"id":"cleansing_heart","name":"Cleansing Heart","description":"A palmful of eternal water left by an oceanid.<br/>Though it has already diffused among the depths of the lake, its purity remains all the same. But why would a creature so pure and clean as an oceanid covet the appearance of a being that roams the land, and assume such a form with pure water? They need not breathe nor do they require sustenance...","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Oceanids"],"rarity":4},{"id":"everflame_seed","name":"Everflame Seed","description":"A seed that fuels the unending flames of the Pyro Regisvine. It emits Pyro energy as if it will burn all that has ever sprouted from the ground.<br/>Endless desires flow among turbulent energy deep within the earth. What desire could steadily hold such fire to the plants and long so eagerly to bathe everything in unquenchable flames?","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Pyro Regisvines"],"rarity":4},{"id":"hoarfrost_core","name":"Hoarfrost Core","description":"The exposed core of a defeated Cryo Regisvine. Pure Cryo energy is contained within it.<br/>Energy and thoughts that swell deep within the earth will eventually erupt on the surface. Even the deathly silent frost will attach to living things on the ground, turning even ordinary vegetation like vines into huge, vicious predators.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Cryo Regisvines"],"rarity":4},{"id":"hurricane_seed","name":"Hurricane Seed","description":"The imploded form of an Anemo Hypostasis upon its defeat.<br/>Contains the essence of Anemo energy.<br/>It is said that the power to create hurricanes resides within its seemingly fragile body. This butterfly of pure Anemo energy must surely be waiting for the day when it can conjure up storms once again.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Anemo Hypostases"],"rarity":4},{"id":"juvenile_jade","name":"Juvenile Jade","description":"A crystalline substance taken from a Primo Geovishap. Within it is contained the potential to become a dragon.<br/>These dull crystals are precipitated within the bodies of vishaps sleeping in the mountains. Liyue folklore holds that they will gather power over many years, after which this crystal will, at last, replace their original heart, and the vishap will become a true dragon â€” one that can shake the mountains and split the earth.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ primo geovishaps"],"rarity":4},{"id":"lightning_prism","name":"Lightning Prism","description":"An Electro Hypostasis channels nearby elemental energy to repair damaged elemental entities. Contains the essence of Electro energy.<br/>An ordinary prism separates white light into its component colors; a Lightning Prism, however, channels flowing energy and weaves them into lightning.
