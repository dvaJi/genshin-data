The process has brought out the distinct flavors of both kinds of meat, making for an especially tasty soup.",

      "description": "A soup dish that's been stewed for a good long while. The inexpert heat control has caused the fresh meat to be a bit tough, and the salty ham has covered the expected taste. The bamboo shoots, which have absorbed the flavors of both meats, are probably the only acceptable part of this dish.",
