  "description": "A handful of tail scales from the Great Wolf King of the North. Even without its physical body and beyond death, Andrius still possesses extraordinary powers. It took a form comprised of ice and wind to embrace a new challenge, but even such form could not house all of its power. The ice scales that fell during the battle still retain some of its spiritual energy.",
